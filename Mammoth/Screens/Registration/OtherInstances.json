CWs are a big part of the culture of the Fediverse, and CWing potentially upsetting content is how we keep our community and the wider Fediverse safe and supportive for everyone.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:<\/p>\n\n<p><ol type=\"a\"><\/p>\n\n<p><li>Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.<\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><li>Aggregating, posting, and\/or disseminating a person&#39;s demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called &quot;doxing&quot;) will be considered harassment.<\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><li>Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called &quot;brigading&quot; or &quot;dogpiling&quot;) may be considered harassment.<\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><\/ol><\/p>\n\n<p><\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><li>Please do not flood the local timeline. We define &quot;flooding&quot; as posting mutliple posts in quick succession to the local\/public timeline (but the definition is flexible; judgements on flooding will be made in context). Flooding drowns out other users and annoys instances we federate with. \n    <ul><li>You can reply to the toots of others and banter back and forth as much as you want, as replies aren&#39;t shown on the local\/public timelines.<\/li>\n    <li>Please avoid posting many pieces of art\/media all at once. Sticking to one post per ten minutes (with one-four pictures attached) is a good baseline to follow. Please respect others&#39; content and statuses so that they can discover other artists in the local timeline.\n    <li>If you&#39;d like to post long threads of many toots, consider marking the first toot as &quot;public&quot;, and the rest in replies marked as &quot;unlisted&quot;. This will allow users to click through the first toot to read the rest of the thread without flooding the local\/public timelines.<\/li><\/ul>\n   <\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Regarding nudity\/lewd\/explicit content:<\/strong> <br>\n <p>  It&#39;s considered good form to put nudity behind a CW as a courtesy for other users in the fediverse at large, and we encourage this practice. Recognizing the subjectivity of the matter, we consider this a recommendation rather than a hard rule where <em>very light<\/em> nudity with no genitalia showing is concerned, and we will approach any reports or complaints on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>\n     <ul><li>Illustrative nudity and body\/anatomy studies with very visible genitalia, and titillating \/ erotic imagery intended for mature audiences,  are allowed on •ART, but <strong>only<\/strong> if tagged appropriately (ex. #lewd, #nudity, etc.) and marked as sensitive or placed under a descriptive content warning.\n       <ul><li>Tags are required so people have the opportunity to filter such content from their timelines altogether.<\/li>\n       <li>Descriptive text is required so that people can make an informed decision about whether to engage with the content behind the CW\/image blur.<\/li>\n        <li>If you&#39;re unsure whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning, consider the following hypothetical questions: Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable viewing in a white collar work situation? Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable being viewed by a minor? Would you happily show it to your parents? A no to any of these questions may require it being CWed\/marked as sensitive. If you&#39;re still unsure, marking it as sensitive\/CWing it is a good bet.\n        <li>Another way to decide whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning is to remember the <strong>Three B&#39;s<\/strong>: If your work features any <strong>B<\/strong>oobs, <strong>B<\/strong>utts, or <strong>B<\/strong>its (genitals), hide that sucker!<\/li>\n       <\/ul>\n       <\/li>\n     <li>Loli or sexual content with characters of questionable age, as well as &#39;ageing up&#39; characters from fandoms that are minors in order to depict them in sexual situations, is expressly prohibited — your account will be suspended. (This includes cub porn.) \n       <\/li>\n      <li>Nude photographs are only allowed if done in an artistic spirit — however, it still needs to be tagged and CWed\/marked as sensitive. Erotic photography, pornography, or photography that puts too much emphasis on the genitals is <strong>not allowed<\/strong>, even if marked &quot;Unlisted&quot;\/&quot;Followers Only&quot;.<\/li>\n      <li>We understand that these things are subjective, but final interpretation of these rules are up to our moderation team.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p><li>Gore, vore, and blood violence must also be placed under a descriptive content warning or marked sensitive.<\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><li> No NFT content. No advertising NFTs, no selling NFTs, no linking to off-platform NFTs or NFT content, no images connected to NFTs.<\/li><\/p>\n\n<p><li> AI-generated imagery (images generated by a neural network that has been trained using other people&#39;s work without their consent) is not allowed at all. Sharing links to external articles discussing AI imagery is fine, but if the article will place a preview of an AI-generated image in your toot, please place it behind a content warning.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p><li>•ART&#39;s administration team reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, as well as to remove your data at any time due to inactivity of any duration (to help against future unmonitored accounts from being hacked and becoming spam bots), unethical use, or usage against •ART’s CoC\/ToS.

While failure to use these these are not strictly moderation worth events, we do ask that you respect and try and conform to these norms as you explore and grow on the platform.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"our-discretion\">Our Discretion<\/h3>\n\n<p>We want to foster an open discussion where <b>everyone<\/b> feels welcome. The rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the staff of this instance has ultimate discretion on how they are enforced. We may alter to these rules as needed, but will make an effort to notify you of any major change.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are found to be in violation, the staff may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion from the server.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"your-account\">Your Account<\/h2>\n\n<p>You may your close account or move it to another instance at any time. You are in control of your identity and your social graph on Mastodon (and other federated instances) but the administrators here control your ability to use this instance and ultimately to interact with its users.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to regular backups we make of our infrastructure, you can backup your data and export it at any time. You can also delete your account and your data at anytime. You can even schedule regular deletions of previous posts, if that's your thing.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"data-security\">Data Security<\/h3>\n\n<p>Unless it's required of us to investigate a reported instance of abuse of our policies, under standard operation we have no ability to regularly access your direct messages with other members of our platform. While this data is accessible with a request to our hosting providers database systems, we expect that to not be necessary except under extreme circumstances. Where possible we will notify you if such processes are taken for data associated by your account.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, due in part to the open and federated nature of Mastodon instances, the Mastodon administrators of other instances you interact with may have access to your data.<\/p>\n\n<p>While the connection to this site is encrypted, this is only the data in transit to you and to other servers in the federated network. <strong>The messages and data stored in the instance is not encrypted.<\/strong> This includes direct messages sent to other users of masto.nu! This is not a choice of the administrator, but a limitation of the Mastodon platform. Additionally, our hosting provider may have access to your data as part of the general administration of the server infrastructure.<\/p> \n\n<p>You should use Signal, Matrix, or another E2E messaging app for the things you really want to be private.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please review our full <a href=\"https:\/\/masto.nu\/terms\">Privacy Policy<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"trending-features\">Trending Features<\/h2>\n\n<p>One of the key features of Mastodon is there's no sophisticated algorithm to drive more traffic to the site, or influence your thinking. Mastodon does offer hashtag, post, and link trending features that are based solely on observed activity within masto.nu and other federated instances.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hashtags largely trend on their own without moderator intervention, but can be removed if they are abusive or disruptive. Some links will trend automatically if they're from mainstream or other sources known to be reputable. Some posts will trend automatically if they're from known figures with a history of appropriate content. Other trends are manually approved by our staff, and only removed if they are deemed inappropriate.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"funding\">Funding<\/h2>\n\n<p>It is not required to pay for continued access to your account, but if you feel obliged to help cover the cost of running masto.nu, please visit one of our sponsor pages to help keep us going.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sponsors\/mkevenaar\"><img src=\"https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/GitHub-sponsors-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=GitHub\" alt=\"Sponsor me on GitHub\" class=\"sponsor\"><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.buymeacoffee.com\/mkevenaar\"><img src=\"https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/Buy%20Me%20A%20Coffee-mkevenaar-FFDD00.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=buy-me-a-coffee\" alt=\"Buy me a Coffee\"   class=\"sponsor\"><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/mkevenaar\"><img src=\"https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/Patreon-mkevenaar-red.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=Patreon\" alt=\"Sponsor me on Patreon\" class=\"sponsor\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>If we exceed the minimum goal then additional funding will be used to increase capacity, or to make periodic donations to Mastodon gGmbH and other groups supporting development of the platform.<\/p>\n","prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","nudity_all","pornography_nocw","pornography_all","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising"]},"users":"20519","active_users":439,"name":"masto.nu","thumbnail":"https:\/\/media.masto.nu\/masto-nu-media\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/001\/@1x\/71ef559219d61b69.png"},{"info":{"full_description":"<h1>欢迎来到 o3o（嘟站）!<\/h1>\n\n<p>欢迎来到o3o(嘟站)！这是一个泛话题社区，无论你的兴趣是什么，你都可以自由地通过发布“嘟嘟”来吐槽一切、摸鱼扯皮。\n本社区由位于加拿大的<a href=\"https:\/\/o3o.foundation\/\" target=\"_blank\">O3O<\/a>非盈利项目运营。我们相信由社会组织运营基本通讯软件和设施是必要的，它们不应被控制在大型企业和政府手中。<\/p>\n\n<p>在这里，你可以通过发布“嘟嘟”来吐槽一切、摸鱼扯皮。无论你的兴趣点是什么，我们欢迎任何热情、友好、乐于分享的朋友们加入。请遵循互相尊重的原则，并遵守本站的<a href=\"https:\/\/codeberg.org\/o3o\/o3o-admin\/src\/branch\/master\/terms.md\" target=\"_blank\">《O3O主题或发言规则》<\/a>。<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>本站点基于开源软件长毛象（Mastodon）建立。不同于微博或 Twitter，这是一个开源的去中心化社交网络。去中心化设计防止社交数据被利益集团垄断，也增加了屏蔽审查的难度。整个长毛象网络由上千个实例组成，这些实例相互连接，最终形成了一个庞大的网络，就像是一个巨大宇宙。每一个服务器都是宇宙中的一个星系，用户就是每个星系里的行星。你可以随时导出自己的账户并转移到其他实例中，无需担心因为实例运营者的问题导致的数据丢失。<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>请参阅<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.joinmastodon.org\/zh-cn\/\" target=\"_blank\">《长毛象中文用户使用文档》<\/a>了解如何使用长毛象。<br><br><\/p>\n\n<h1>捐助本站<\/h1>\n\n<p>o3o开放捐助通道啦，欢迎有能力的朋友酌情进行捐助，帮助我们维持服务器运营，继续打造开放、自由、有趣的长毛象社区！ 作为感谢，每一位捐助者都可以获得一枚 @ o3o.ca 域邮件地址以作纪念。请访问 <a href=\"https:\/\/o3o.foundation\/donate\/\" target=\"_blank\">捐助页面<\/a>开始捐助或获取财务信息披露。<\/p>\n\n<h1>联系我们<\/h1>\n\n<p>如果无法通过站内私信联系站长们，可发送邮件至 admin[at]o3o.ca。<\/p>\n\n<h1>长毛象概念介绍<\/h1>\n\n<video width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/mstdn-s3.o3o.studio\/what-is-mastodon-zh_cn.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">\n<\/video>\n\n<p>字幕翻译：Nebula<\/p>\n\n<p><br><br><\/p>\n\n<h2>社区规则<\/h2>\n\n<p>为了您安家后的使用体验，<strong>请详细阅读<a href=\"https:\/\/codeberg.org\/o3o\/o3o-admin\/src\/branch\/master\/terms.md\" target=\"_blank\">O3O社区规则<\/a><\/strong>。\n<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>如果你不喜欢本站的主题或发言规则，可以从<a href=\"https:\/\/joinmastodon.org\/\">这里<\/a>或<a href=\"https:\/\/instances.social\/list#lang=zh\">这里<\/a>中选择更适合你的实例。记住，除非你选择实例明确阻隔了其他某个或某些实例，你永远可以和整个Mastodon社区的用户交互。\n<br><\/p>\n\n<h2>使用指南<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.joinmastodon.org\/zh-cn\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon 中文官方文档<\/a>\n<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Mastodon 的去中心化设计防止了社交数据被少数公司或团体垄断的风险，也大大增加了屏蔽及过滤的难度。如果你有兴趣动手搭建一个实例，请参考<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.joinmastodon.org\/zh-cn\/\">官方文档<\/a>。\n<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>你可以随时<a href=\"\/settings\/export\">导出<\/a>备份自己的数据并申请转移到其他实例中而无需担心因为实例运营者的问题导致的数据丢失。如果你有更多关于Mastodon的问题，请参考<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.joinmastodon.org\/zh-cn\/\">官方中文文档<\/a>。\n<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>本站原则上只使用官方 Stable 代码，所有包括汉化等问题将在 <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mastodon\/mastodon\/releases\">Github<\/a> 上提交。有编程经验的朋友不妨加入我们一起来让长毛象更萌，更可爱吧。\n<br><\/p>\n\n<h1>自定义表情包<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n <li>阿鲁 -

Es basiert auf offenen Web-Protokollen und freier, quelloffener Software. Es ist dezentral (so wie E-Mail!).<\/p>\n<h5>Infos zu Mastodon findest du auf beispielsweise unter folgenden Links:<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mobilsicher.de\/ratgeber\/mastodon-das-bessere-twitter\">Mastodon – das bessere Twitter?

Die Moderation setzt diese Regeln aktiv durch. Nichtbeachtung kann verschiedene Maßnahmen wie einfache Ermahnungen, Löschung von Beiträgen, zeitweise\/dauerhafte Sperrungen bis hin zur Löschung eines Kontos zur Folge haben.<br>\nEinige dieser Maßnahmen können auch bei Nutzer:innen anderer Instanzen erfolgen. Auch die Sperrung aller Inhalte anderer Instanzen ist möglich.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Accounts<\/h3>\n<p>Diese Instanz ist für den persönlichen Austausch natürlicher Nutzer:innen und der Präsentation von Vereinigungen oder Organisationen mit Sitz in Hessen gedacht. Voll-automatisierte Accounts sind nicht gestattet. Das schließt insbesondere Accounts ein, auf denen mit Automationswerkzeugen geposted, aber nie anders interagiert wird (Antworten, Boosten, etc.). Ausnahmen von dieser Regelung siehe „Bots“.<br>\nAktive Nutzer:innen dürfen ergänzend Werkzeuge für automatisches Posten verwenden. (z.B. Crossposter).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Mindestalter<\/h3>\nUnser Angebot erfordert eine Zustimmung zu den Datenschutzrichtlinien. Gemäß DSGVO ist dies nur Personen möglich die das 16. Lebensjahr vollendet haben. Wenn du unter 16 Jahren bist, darfst du diese Plattform daher leider nicht benutzen.\n\n<h3>Allgemeine Verhaltensregeln<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sei immer freundlich und höflich. Behandle andere mit Respekt.<\/li>\n<li>Belästige und beleidige niemanden und unterlasse persönliche Angriffe.Weder allein noch als Gruppe. Das Veröffentlichen oder die Androhung von Veröffentlichung von personen-identifizierenden Informationen (\"doxing\") wird als Belästigung ausgelegt.<\/li>\n<li>Kontaktiere keine Nutzer:innen die angegeben haben, dass sie nicht kontaktiert werden möchten.<\/li>\n<li>Die Nutzung oder Befürwortung von rassistischer, sexistischer, homophober, transphober, behindertenfeindlicher und anderweitig diskriminierender oder hasserfüllter Sprache bzw. verharmlosende oder gutheißende Inhalte zu Weißer Vorherrschaft, Antisemitismus, Transphobie oder anderen hasserfüllten Ideologien wird nicht geduldet.<\/li>\n<li>Nochmal ganz deutlich: Wir dulden keine nationalistische Propaganda, keine Nazi-Symbolik und keine Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus!<\/li>\n<li>Nachgewiesene Falschinformationen\/Fakenews sind hier unerwünscht.<\/li>\n<li>Poste keine pornographischen oder sexualisierten Inhalte. Dazu gehören auch Witze und Kommentare.<\/li>\n<li>Halte dich an die in Deutschland geltenden Gesetze (verbietet u.a. auch gewaltverherrlichende Inhalte).<\/li>\n<li>Veröffentliche keinen Spam oder kommerzielle Werbung. Kommerzielle Werbung in diesem Zusammenhang bedeutet, wenn die veröffentlichten Inhalte keinen persönlichen Bezug aufweisen und eindeutig dazu gedacht sind, direkt oder indirekt Geld zu erwirtschaften.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Öffentliche Toots<\/h3>\n<p>Bei öffentliche Toots müssen zusätzlich die folgende Punkte beachtet werden:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><h5>Nutze Inhaltswarnungen<\/h5>\nVeröffentliche keine Inhalte über kontroverse, aufrührerische oder triggernde Themen ohne eine Inhaltswarnung zu verwenden.<\/li>\n<li><h5>Keine Killerphrasen, schwarze Rhetorik oder Sophismus<\/h5>\nDies gebietet bereits ein respektvoller Umgang. Dennoch möchten wir nochmals betonen, dass unsachliche Diskussionsbeiträge die der vorsätzlichen Schädigung der Diskussion zur Folge haben unerwünscht sind. Dazu zählen bspw. auch Scheinargument-Attacken (auch ad hominem genannt) oder die Kritik an inklusiver Sprache, wenn diese nicht das Thema der Diskussion ist.<\/li>\n<li><h5>Kritik an Moderationsentscheidungen<\/h5>\nDiskutiere Moderationsentscheidungen nicht zuerst in öffentlichen Toots. Wenn Du nicht einverstanden bist wie ein Moderation diese Bedingungen interpretiert und anwendet, dann kontaktiere uns. Schicke eine Mail an kontakt@hessen.social oder schreibe eine Direktnachricht an @moomendemol@hessen.social<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Bugs<\/h3>\n<p>Gefundene Fehler in der Software auf hessen.social sind umgehend zu melden.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Melden & Moderation<\/h3>\n<p>Wenn dir hier ein Toot auffällt, der diesen Kodex verletzt, melde das bitte immer. Es ist gut möglich, dass jemand anderes diesen Inhalt bereits gemeldet hat. Allerdings passiert es schnell, dass alle so denken und es am Ende niemand meldet.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Bots<\/h3>\n<p>Spezielle Bot-Accounts sind erlaubt, soweit sie die nachfolgenden Bedingungen erfüllen.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Es gelten die gleichen Regelungen wie für alle anderen Accounts.<\/li>\n<li>Es muss eine erreichbare Kontaktperson in der Beschreibung des Bots in einem Tabellenfeld 'Kontaktperson' zu finden sein.<\/li>\n<li>Die Profilbeschreibung muss einen kurzen Text über den Sinn und Zweck des Bots enthalten.<\/li>\n<li>Bots dürfen lediglich Nicht gelistet posten, um mehr Raum für relevantere, lokale Inhalte zu bieten.<\/li>\n<li>Ausnahmen von diesen Regelungen sind nach Absprache möglich.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Unzulässige\/gesperrte Maildomains<\/h3>\n<p>Aufgrund von zunehmenden Spamaccounts wurde die Nutzung von Wegwerfmailadressen und häufigen Spammerdomains unterbunden (siehe auch nächsten Abschnitt zu gmail.com).<br>\nDie gesperrten Domains finden sich hier: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/disposable-email-domains\/disposable-email-domains\">https:\/\/github.com\/disposable-email-domains\/disposable-email-domains<\/a>\n<br><br>\nSollte sich in dieser Liste eine Domain befinden die ihr selber nutzt und dort als falsch erachtet, könnt ihr<br>\n1. unter dem o.g. Link ein Issue eröffnen um die Domain von der Sperrliste zu nehmen<br>\n2. falls 1. nicht klappt oder nicht möglich ist, uns eine Mail schreiben um eine lokale Ausnahme zu erstellen.<\/p>\n\n<h3>GMail-Nutzer:innen<\/h3>\n<p>Nach zwei Wochen Betrieb zeigt sich bereits, dass von Maildomains mit der Endung \"@gmail.com\" eine enorme Menge Spamaccounts angelegt werden. Daher ist die Domain ab sofort gesperrt.\nWenn du eine Google-Adresse nutzen willst, dann ersetze @gmail.com einfach durch @googlemail.com, das funktioniert auch. Alternativ kannst du natürlich auch eine andere Mailadresse nehmen, am besten von einem Mailprovider der deine Mailinhalte nicht durchforstet und zu Werbezwecken nutzt.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Automatische Löschung von Accounts<\/h3>\n<p>Wir behalten uns vor, Nutzeraccounts, die keine Aktivität zeigen, zu löschen. Die Aktivität wird unter anderem am letzten Login und der Tootaktivität festgemacht. So fallen bspw. Accounts die 3 Monate ohne Login sind und noch nie etwas getootet haben unter diese Regelung.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Rechtliches<\/h3>\nBei der Nutzung des Angebots findet deutsches Recht Anwendung.

This includes anti-Indigenous\/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.<\/li>\n  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.<\/li>\n  <li>Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of \"dead\" or rejected names.<\/li>\n  <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.<\/li>\n  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \"hug\" or \"backrub\") without consent or after a request to stop.<\/li>\n  <li>Threats of violence.<\/li>\n  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.<\/li>\n  <li>Deliberate intimidation.<\/li>\n  <li>Stalking or following - online or in the physical world.<\/li>\n  <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.<\/li>\n  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.<\/li>\n  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.<\/li>\n  <li>Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting\/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.<\/li>\n  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.<\/li>\n  <li>Deliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.<\/li>\n  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.<\/li>\n  <li>Jokes that resemble the above, such as \"hipster racism\", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reporting<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you think that an account on this instance is violating this Code of Conduct, or is doing something offensive or should be otherwise handled by the administrators, the easiest way to report them is to use the reporting tool that is part of Mastodon. You can do that using the 'Report' tool which is embedded in every toot:\n  <br>\n    <img src=\"\/report.png\" \/>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>If you would rather not use the reporting tool, if the harassment\n  is happening outside of botsin.space, or if you have any other\n  concerns, please contact the administrators via the methods listed at\n  the top of this page. If the person who is harassing you is on the\n  admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the\n  incident.<\/p>\n\n<p>The admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as\n  possible we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and\/or contacting the admins by email at colin at muffinlabs dot com.<\/p>\n\n<p>This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you\n  are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we\n  still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of\n  harassment by our members, especially the administrators,\n  seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment\n  that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the\n  right to exclude people from the community based on their past\n  behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior\n  towards people who are not in this community.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve\n  the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad\n  faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted\n  without response.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Enforcement Process<\/h2>\n\n<p>Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with\n  seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is\n  threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem\n  appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from\n  the community. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will\n  discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which\n  will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution\n  that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a\n  violation case will be considered final.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of\n  protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a\n  person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately\n  warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will\n  increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not\n  name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Consequences<\/h2>\n\n<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to\n  comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,\n  the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to\n  and including expulsion from the community and identification of the\n  participant as a harasser to other members. At the discretion of the\n  admins, or by request, one or more of the parties involved may request\n  to discuss the violation and how to avoid similar situations in the\n  future.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Acknowledgements<\/h2>\n\n<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Community Covenant (<a href=\"http:\/\/community-covenant.net\">http:\/\/community-covenant.net<\/a>), version 1.0, available at <a href=\"http:\/\/community-covenant.net\/version\/1\/0\/\">http:\/\/community-covenant.net\/version\/1\/0\/<\/a>.

(\"Punching up\": making jokes or criticism at the expense of those with more power, higher status or greater privilege.)<\/li>\n  <li>Non-academic, \"off-topic\" stuff is allowed, but try to post this as Unlisted, not as Public<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Who is welcome on Scholar Social? Do I need to be a full-time student, teacher or researcher?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The \"topic\" for this instance is: academia, research, teaching and learning, which is intentionally a very broad topic. You do not need an advanced degree to join (or any degree, for that matter).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you consider yourself a scholar of any sort, and you are willing to engage with others respectfully, and you will respect our community's efforts to make this a safe space for queer people and other minorities, you are absolutely welcome here.<\/p>\n\n<p>This instance was specifically started to provide a safe space for queer people and other minorities in academia. Due to the antagonistic relationship that law enforcement has often had with these groups, police officers, military and employees of any law enforcement or intelligence agency are not welcome on this instance.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Introduce yourself!<\/h2>\n\n<p>After signing up, post a message to the Local Timeline telling us who you are, what your academic interests are, and helping us to get to know you better. I have set the administrative account to automatically boost public posts tagged with #introductions. (But if you abuse this by using it for anything else, I will close your account without warning.)<\/p>\n\n<p><a name=\"cw\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2>Content Warnings (CW's)<\/h2>\n\n<p>Please add CW's (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n      <li>strong language,<\/li>\n      <li>rants,<\/li>\n      <li>selfies,<\/li>\n      <li>current events (includes: US or non-US, local, national, international, and should be applied regardless of whether sources are academic or non-partisan),<\/li>\n      <li>high-conflict or otherwise exhausting issues of popular debate (e.g. climate change, GMO's, privacy issues, elections, etc.),<\/li>\n      <li>mentions of death or violence,<\/li>\n      <li>photographs or illustrations of insects, genitals, wounds (even if they come from a scientific source)<\/li>\n      <li>references or links to Facebook\/Twitter\/other big tech companies,<\/li>\n      <li>spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,<\/li>\n      <li>ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn't have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)<\/li>\n      <li>stresses particular to academia such as grades, exams, thesis progress, academic job market prospects, and<\/li>\n      <li>anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don't want to click through each one.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Image descriptions<\/h2>\n\n<p>It is an expectation of this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like \"image.jpg\" that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)<\/p>\n\n<p>If you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is an expectation of this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Local Timeline<\/h2>\n\n<p>Be conscious of how much space you take up on the Local Timeline. This is the instance's \"kitchen table,\" where we all hang out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Posts on the Local Timeline (ones with the \"Public\" privacy setting) will be checked to ensure that Content Warnings are applied, images are described, and other expectations are followed. Unlisted posts will not be proactively reviewed, but will still be subject to rules regarding abuse and other hate-speech.<\/p>\n\n<p>Make the first post of a thread Public if you want it on the Local Timeline, and subsequent posts Unlisted. We strongly recommend one thread per academic conference, for example.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The \"official\" Mastodon app is NOT recommended for use on Scholar Social, as it does not allow for posting using the \"Unlisted\" privacy setting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use a CW or post as Unlisted if you're not sure that your post is \"on-topic.\" The Scholar Social Local Timeline is not meant to be a current events news aggregator, and if your post seems to fall into this category, you may be asked to delete and re-draft it with a CW or as an Unlisted post. Let's try to avoid turning the Local Timeline into the same rehashing of the outrage-of-the-day that we see on Twitter!<\/p>\n\n<p>Not <em>every<\/em> post on the Local Timeline should be CW'd, but most should. Do your best to try to accommodate each other, and try to be understanding when there is a clash of expectations or needs.<\/p>\n\n<p><a name=\"postsdeleted\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2>Unwelcome conduct on Scholar Social<\/h2>\n\n<p>The following will result in: a warning from the admin or having offending posts deleted, possibly without prior notice.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Providing unsolicited advice to strangers<\/li>\n  <li>Inappropriate un-CW'd posts on the Local Timeline (see above for CW policies)<\/li>\n  <li>Posts with un-described images or video<\/li>\n  <li>Shortened links, e.g. bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd or t.co (These are considered malicious because link-shorteners track users without their consent and obscure the destination address, which also prevents users from being able to decide whether they want to visit the link beforehand)<\/li>\n  <li>Advertisement or apologia for cryptocurrencies, NFT's, or multi-level marketing schemes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Exceptions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>DOI links (e.g. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.k959) are allowed but the post must accurately describe the title\/author\/journal to allow the reader to decide for themselves whether they would like to follow the link.

(E.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CW's on every discussion of race; a straight person who reports a queer person for writing \"I hate straight people\" may find their own account suspended.)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.social\/terms\">Full terms of service<\/a><\/p>\n","languages":["en"]},"name":"scholar.social"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/rollenspiel.social\/system\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/003\/@1x\/40f9587c73fa9c9a.png","active_users":506,"info":{"full_description":"<div id=\"badges\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/gui.fediseer.com\/instances\/detail\/rollenspiel.social\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fediseer.com\/api\/v1\/badges\/endorsements\/rollenspiel.social.svg\" alt=\"fediseer endorsements\"><\/a>\n    <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/fedimins.net\/covenant\/\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fediseer.com\/api\/v1\/badges\/endorsements\/rollenspiel.social.svg\" alt=\"fedimins covenant\"><\/a>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>\n  Hier geht es zu den <a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.monster\/terms\">Nutzungsbedingungen<\/a><br \/>\n  Hier geht es zur <a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.monster\/charta\/mastodon\/\">Charta<\/a><br \/>\n  Hier geht es zum <a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.monster\/imprint\">Impressum<\/a><br \/>\n  Hier geht es zu den <a href=\"\/terms#datenschutzinformation\">Datenschutzinformation<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>Teil vom <a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.monster\/\">RollenspielMonster Softwareangebot<\/a>, schaut doch einfach mal vorbei.<\/p>\n\n<p>Die Instanz ist Mitglied von Fedimin.net und unterstützt das <a href=\"http:\/\/fedimins.net\/covenant\">Serverabkommen<\/a><\/p>\n\n<div>\n  <h2 id=\"team\">Team<\/h2>\n  <h3 id=\"owner\">Owner<\/h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.social\/Tealk\">Tealk<\/a><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  <h3 id=\"admin\">Admin<\/h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.social\/@ZarJohn\">ZarJohn<\/a><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  <h3 id=\"moderator\">Moderator<\/h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.social\/@rkbw\">rkbw<\/a><\/li>\n    <li><a href=\"https:\/\/rollenspiel.social\/@Frank\">Frank<\/a><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","nudity_all","pornography_nocw","pornography_all","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising","spoilers_nocw"],"short_description":"rollenspiel.social wird von RollenspielMonster bereitgestellt.

Reports will be kept confidential.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We do not tolerate discriminatory behaviour or content promoting\/advocating the oppression of members of marginalised groups. These groups may be characterized by any of the following (though this list is naturally incomplete): Ethnicity or race; Gender identity or expression; Sexual identity or expression; Physical characteristics or age; Disability or illness; Nationality, residency, citizen status; Wealth or education; Religious affiliation, agnosticism, or atheism; Neurodivergence<\/li>\n\n<li>We do not tolerate threatening behavior, stalking, or doxxing.<\/li>\n<li>We do not tolerate harassment, including brigading, dogpiling, or any other form of contact with a user who has stated that they do not wish to be contacted.<\/li>\n<li>We do not tolerate mobbing, including name-calling, intentional misgendering, or deadnaming.<\/li>\n<li>We do not tolerate violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism, or promoting the ideology of National Socialism.<\/li>\n<li>We do not tolerate conspiracy narratives or other reactionary myths supporting or leading to the above-mentioned (and\/or similar) behavior.<\/li>\n<li>Scientific discussion is critical to our community. However, conspiracy theories related to anti-vaxx and COVID19 without any scientific basis will not be tolerated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Actions intended to damage this instance or its performance may lead to immediate temporary or permanent account suspension.<\/p>\n\n<p>Content that is illegal in the United States will be deleted and may lead to immediate account suspension.<\/p>\n\n<h2>General Best Practices<\/h2>\n\n<p>The list below is a collection of behaviors that we expect to see from our users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and we will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.<\/li>\n<li>When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.<\/li>\n<li>Uninvited comments about another user's personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.<\/li>\n<li>If you post sexual content or gore, use content warnings.<\/li>\n<li>If you post advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.<\/li>\n<li>Bots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.<\/li>\n<li>Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter \"retweets\" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions (\"…@twitter.com\"). Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in our community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.<\/li>\n<li>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to. When using sarcasm, please indicate with \/s.<\/li>\n<li>Please be mindful of your language, and avoid the use of ableist and saneist language. We recognize that sometimes it can be hard to find another word to clearly communicate what you are trying to say. We have created a resource to help you find alternative language while still being able to convey your point.<\/li>\n<li>Please use captions in uploaded videos.<\/li>\n<li>There are times when users just want to vent about their situation. Unless requested explicitly, please do not drop unsolicited advice. In some cases, it might be ok to ask OP directly if they want advice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Best Practices to Assist Screen Readers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some of our users make use of screen readers. There are a few things that make for a smoother experience:\n<ul>\n    <li>Reminder to alt-text your images. If you are low on spoons, please use #AltTextHelp and someone from the community should be able to help and provide it.<\/li>\n    <li>Avoid using multiple emojis in a row. Ex: putting 3 smiley faces in a row, or 60 red flags.<\/li>\n    <li>If you want to use hashtags throughout a toot, please do so sparingly. Best to put the majority of them at the end of the toot.<\/li>\n    <li>Use CamelCase for the hashtags. Ex: #DisabledSocial<\/li>\n    <li>Please use as few emoji in usernames or screen names as possible (preferably none)<\/li>\n    <li>Please don&#39;t scatter emojis between words in an alternating pattern. Ex: word followed by clapping hands emoji, repeated indefinitely. Use them sparingly.<\/li>\n    <li>When sharing a link, please provide a brief description of where the link directs to.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p>(These best practices were inspired by the Terms of chaos.social. Thank you!)<\/p>\n\n<h2>Mutual Aid<\/h2>\n\n<p>The posting and sharing of mutual aid and fundraisers are welcome here on disabled.social because they are critical for the survival of some of our members. Disability payments are often woefully inadequate to meet the much higher cost of living as a chronically ill and\/or disabled person. These types of things are sometimes the only way that someone can afford rent, can afford to move out of a terrible housing situation, to be able to afford a mobility aid, etc. Please do not report these posts as spam. If they bother you, you can filter them out of your feed. And regarding the hashtags used: that is up to the discretion of the member who is posting. They know which hashtags are best for their specific situation.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Attribution<\/h2>\n\n<p>This instance uses <a href='https:\/\/mutant.tech'>Mutant Standard emoji<\/a>, which are licensed under a <a href='https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/4.0\/'>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Admin\/Mod Commitment to Non-Commercialization Statement<\/h2>\n\n<p>We all would like to reiterate that regardless of what any of us do for work, research, or advocacy, we will not be individually trying to commercialize the disabled.social instance.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Instance Blog<\/h2>\n\n<p>Our instance has a blog!

A moderação irá avaliar cada situação individualmente.<\/p>\n\n<p>Caso a sua denúncia seja relativa a um dos moderadores, você pode reportar a violação através de mensagem direta à um dos outros moderadores.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fazemos um esforço para que as denúncias sejam processadas em até 24 horas, mas somos pessoas com vidas fora do Mastodon e eventualmente pode demorar um pouco mais.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"inatividade\">Inatividade<\/h2>\n\n<p>Contas inativas por mais de um ano estão sujeitas a serem removidas da plataforma.

Grab a hot cocoa or coffee from the bar, kick back and relax.  This is meant to be a friendly and welcoming space for all kinds of plural systems and plural-friendly singlets alike.\n\n<p>For our Privacy Policy and some server information, see our <a href=https:\/\/plural.cafe\/terms>Terms of Service page<\/a>.\n\n<p>We're also listed on Plural Hub! <a href=https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/2tFRMBw target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check them out on Discord<\/a> to see more plural communities and resources.\n\n<p>Your moderators are: <a href=https:\/\/starfall.plural.cafe>@starfall<\/a>\n\n<p>You can contact the moderators through the report feature, by emailing <a href=mailto:\/\/admin@plural.cafe>admin@plural.cafe<\/a>, or by messaging us directly. <a href=https:\/\/barkeep.plural.cafe>@Barkeep<\/a> is mostly unmonitored but we try to check it at least once a week.\n\n\n<h3>What is Mastodon?<\/h3>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/joyeusenoelle\/GuideToMastodon\/blob\/master\/README.md#an-increasingly-less-brief-guide-to-mastodon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joyeusenoelle's An Increasingly Less-Brief Guide to Mastodon<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>Mastodon is Twitter-style social networking combined with email-style instanced servers. It's named after the metal band, but themed after the extinct megafauna.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each Mastodon instance is independent but networked, like email servers. If you sign up for an email account on gmail.com, you don't automatically have an account on hotmail.com or aol.com, but you can send and receive messages to and from users on hotmail.com and aol.com.<\/p>\n\n<p>Likewise, if you sign up for an account on mastodon.social, that doesn't make an account for you on every other instance, but you can talk to users from other instances and they can talk to you.<\/p>\n\n<h3>What is Plurality?<\/h3>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https:\/\/pluralityresource.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plurality Resource<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>The most simplified definition of the term plural that includes all people who take the label is “someone who shares the same physical body with other individuals.”  Such a group is sometimes referred to as a system, though many plural groups use different terminology.  Because plurality can take many vastly different forms, it is difficult to expand this definition without excluding someone who might otherwise share characteristics or concerns with most other members of the community.  It does seem this basic trait is the only thing groups of people who refer to themselves as plural universally share.  In other words, there are many, many ways to be plural, and no two systems are the same even as far as basic characteristics.  There are a lot of trends in the community, however, and various types within the umbrella term of plural that seem to be subsets.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a prevailing theory in the community that sees plurality as a spectrum going from singlet (one person in one physical body) to median (a term describing groups that have one main member plus others who are somewhat separate) to multiple (a group of distinct individuals in which more than one person can take control of the physical body).  Groups who deviate from these subsets are seen as occupying an in-between ground along the spectrum.<\/p>\n\n<p>More information can be found on <a href=\"https:\/\/morethanone.info\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More Than One<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/healthymultiplicity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthy Multiplicity<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/tulpa.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tulpa.io<\/a>, or the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.karitas.net\/blackbirds\/layman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blackbirds' Layman's Guide to Multiplicity<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Instance Policy<\/h2>\n\n<h3>CW\/Triggers List<\/h3>\n\n<p>No list of triggers can be complete, but these are some common ones that we ask for content warning \/ subject line on:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>abuse\n    <li>alcohol and other drugs\n    <li>COVID-19\n    <li>death\n    <li>flashing or rapidly moving images\n    <li>food, eating, dieting, and weight loss\n    <li>graphic violence, blood, and gore\n    <li>misinformation and unreality\n    <li>self harm, suicide, and suicidal ideation\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Most people also content warn for eye contact, current events \/ electoral politics, and racism \/ other oppression they face. We don&#39;t have a rule requiring these because content warning requests have been abused to silence Black users on fedi in the past.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Bots Policy<\/h3>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Bots should not post on public privacy. Twitter crossposters and similar automated posts can be on public as long as you also respond to people from your account here.\n    <li>Bots must be opt-in; that is, they should not follow or interact with accounts that haven't followed or interacted with them first.\n    <li>Bots must be clearly identified as a bot with the \"This is a bot account\" option in their profile.\n<\/ol>\n\n<h3>Federation Policy<\/h3>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Instances where folks regularly break our rules may be silenced or suspended at any time.\n    <li>Now that Mastodon has secure mode, we're not as worried about other folks blocking the same instances we do, but keep in mind that the company you keep does reflect on you, and because of the nature of federation we may find it more expedient to block someone than to deal with the things they federate to us.\n    <li>Unmoderated instances and those that make a point of being \"free speech\" have proven time and again to enable harassment and will be suspended.\n    <li>Instances running the Soapbox frontend will be assumed to be full of assholes until proven wrong. Using the fancy software that was created specifically for TERFs is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong (but not perfect) predictor of transmisogyny.\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><p>The instances that we restrict access to &amp; from can be seen at the bottom of this page. To avoid harassment and legal threats from folks who don&#39;t appreciate that we set boundaries, the reason for blocks is only available when you are logged into Plural Café.<\/p>\n\n<p><p>We are no longer accepting appeal requests for instance suspensions. We have received <strong>8<\/strong> of these requests and removed <strong>3<\/strong> instance blocks after review, of which <strong>2<\/strong> were re-blocked within 6 months.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions<\/h3>\n\n<h4>Do I really have to use those content warnings on <em>every<\/em> post about something?<\/h4>\n\n<p><p>On public posts and replies to your own public posts, yes. For unlisted and followers-only posts, you&#39;re welcome to add the tag to your account bio instead so that folks know what they&#39;re getting into.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Why do you discourage the term \"NSFW\" (Not Safe For Work)?<\/h4>\n\n<p><p>Two reasons.\n<ol>\n    <li>It&#39;s not specific. It doesn&#39;t tell anyone whether they&#39;re going to see a short reference to sex, kink, both together, pornography, a dick joke, or a joke about the unsafe use of ladders. Everyone&#39;s triggers and tolerance for the different subjects is different, and lumping them all together doesn&#39;t help folks make decisions about what they want to read and when they want to read it.\n    <li>Because sex work is real work. &quot;NSFW&quot; might be accurate for most workplaces, but it subtly reinforces those standards on everyone.\n<\/ol>\n<p>It&#39;s not a rule violation, but we would prefer folks use words like &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;lewd&quot; in their content warnings instead of &quot;NSFW&quot;.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Can you give examples of rule 9 (don't take advantage of the rules to try and harm others)?<\/h4>\n\n<p><p>Sure. One example is sealioning - overwhelming someone with &quot;polite&quot; questions while hiding behind the guidance to be gentle with folks who are still learning. Another that we&#39;ve seen fairly often is, after someone is told off by a Black person for racist behavior, trying to smear that Black person as transphobic.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Moderator Expectations &amp; Transparency<\/h3>\n\n<p><p>Moderators are expected to respond to reports and new account requests within 24 hours. Since there&#39;s only one of us at the moment and we also have a full time job, keep in mind that it may sometimes take 16 hours or more for us to get the chance to take a look at things, but we can handle most things in about 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p><p>Handling reports almost always involves us talking to the folks involved before taking any action, but we aren&#39;t afraid to take immediate action in extreme situations. We&#39;ve immediately suspended accounts from Plural Café for things like:\n<ul>\n    <li>Using the n-word on an account outside of Plural Café\n    <li>Complaining about &quot;globalists&quot; (in the anti-semitic conspiracy theory sense) in the replies of someone criticizing white supremacy, while we were typing up a gentle correction to another post of theirs about how free speech, especially in our spaces, still comes with the responsibility not to harm others.\n<\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p><p>Mastodon gives us these moderation tools:\n<ul>\n    <li>Deleting posts (they may still be available on other instances, but they won&#39;t appear on plural.cafe)\n    <li>Issuing warnings\n    <li>Temporarily disabling login to plural.cafe\n    <li>Hiding an account&#39;s posts from anyone who doesn&#39;t follow them (a &quot;limit&quot; or &quot;silence&quot;)\n    <li>Deleting a plural.cafe account or refusing any posts or information about a remote account (a &quot;suspend&quot;)\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that moderators are <em>not<\/em> able to edit the text or content warning of posts.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Code of Conduct \/ Instance Rules Credits<\/h2>\n\n<p><p>Our code of conduct is not directly based on any others, but we spent a fair bit of time reading examples and were inspired by these in particular:\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=https:\/\/adainitiative.org\/2014\/02\/18\/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community\/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Ada Initiative&#39;s how-to on designing a code of conduct.<\/a>\n    <li><a href=https:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/conduct\/ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Django Code of Conduct<\/a>\n    <li><a href=https:\/\/github.com\/18F\/code-of-conduct\/blob\/master\/code-of-conduct.md target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Technology Transformation Service Code of Conduct<\/a>\n    <li><a href=https:\/\/github.com\/stumpsyn\/policies\/blob\/master\/citizen_code_of_conduct.md target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Citizen Code of Conduct<\/a>\n    <li><a href=https:\/\/firestorm.coop\/anti-oppression.html target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Firestorm Collective Anti-Oppression Statement<\/a>\n<\/ul><\/p>\n","categories":["art","furry","lgbt"],"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_nocw","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising","spoilers_nocw"],"languages":["en"]},"users":"1383","thumbnail":"https:\/\/pool.jortage.com\/pluralcafe\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/002\/@1x\/d1dcdef3ed844b78.png","name":"plural.cafe"},{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/mastodon.uy\/system\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/004\/@1x\/a56ee577f962d55d.png","active_users":179,"name":"mastodon.uy","users":"1371","info":{"languages":["en","pt","es"],"categories":[],"full_description":"<p>Abajo podrás encontrar normas del servidor que establecen algunos criterios o pautas generales para favorecer y promover una buena comunicación y convivencia virtual.

If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and the moderators will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, <strong>repeated malicious unwillingness<\/strong> to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n  <li>In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.<\/li>\n  <li>When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.<\/li>\n  <li>Uninvited comments about another user's personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.<\/li>\n  <li>If you post potentially graphical content or gore, use content warnings.<\/li>\n  <li>If you post any advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.<\/li>\n  <li>Bots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.<\/li>\n  <li>Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be <strong>unlisted<\/strong> (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of SEO.chat instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter \"retweets\" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions (\"…@twitter.com\"). Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in SEO.chat community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.<\/li>\n  <li>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don't translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings.<\/li>\n<li>Do not debate moderation actions in public posts.

The moderators will keep your report confidential.\nAccounts found to be breaking the rules will be banned without a warning.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf you notice a post that violates the rules, please report it.

Piccolo è bello ed il sistema federato e decentrato di Mastodon aiuta in questo.<br \/>\nQuesta istanza non vuole essere un semplice luogo di discussione sulla musica scollegato dal contesto, ma un punto d'incontro che stimoli anche una crescita con un confronto continuo sulle metodologie utilizzate, sia in questo spazio che al di fuori di esso.<br \\>\nCrediamo appunto, che le connessioni che influenzano la diffusione e la creazione di determinata musica siano molteplici e noi tutte\/i possiamo partecipare nella definizione di questo.\n\n<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Premessa<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intendendo social network come strumento di comunicazione riconosciamo che negli ultimi anni le soluzioni commerciali (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ecc) hanno acquisito un ruolo preponderante per quanto riguarda il modo di comunicare in rete. Siamo nella situazione in cui parlare di Social Network significa solo identificare i social network commerciali. Profilazione di massa, gamificazione, manipolazione delle informazioni e impossibilit&agrave; della gestione dei propri contenuti sono solo gli elementi problematici maggiormente visibili.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gli attori principali sono in questo campo solo multinazionali che con le loro piattaforme hanno affinato meccanismi che, fondandosi su alcuni concetti sviluppatisi nell'ambito della psicologia cognitiva, spingono l'utente a una sempre maggiore permanenza al loro interno. Parallelamente, per legare ancora di pi&ugrave; gli utenti a s&eacute;, hanno sollecitato un accentramento delle informazioni creando una sorta di bolla che ha in parte raggiunto il loro obiettivo di accentrare tutte le informazioni di cui un utente \"ha bisogno\" quotidianamente.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questi social network con le loro strategie hanno pesantemente modificato le relazioni sociali. Nonostante questo crediamo sia possibile utilizzare strumenti analoghi ma di cui siamo in controllo e il cui funzionamento possiamo decidere collettivamente, allo scopo ad esempio di poter condividere informazioni e discuterle assieme.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crediamo che i movimenti sociali non sono stati capaci di proporre una piattaforma finalizzata all'open publishing non commerciale. Crediamo ovviamente che il motivo non sia la mancanza di capacit&agrave; tecniche, ma (forse) la sfiducia sull'utilit&agrave; di un Social Network, sui danni provocati dal suo utilizzo eccessivo, sull'impossibilit&agrave; di poter competere con la massa degli utenti dei social network commerciali ed il rischio di divenater strumenti di nicchia facilmente attaccabili.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuttavia crediamo che una risposta possibile che si pu&ograve; dare nell'immediato al monopolio incontrastato dei social network commerciali sia tentare strade alternative capaci di creare delle emorragie di utenti e contenuti, con la volont&agrave; di non renderli pi&ugrave; l'unico punto in cui trovare la maggior parte delle informazioni che ci interessano.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Qual &egrave; la nostra idea di \"social network\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troviamo che le piattaforme e i gruppi capaci di gestire un server o servizi autogestiti siano una ricchezza per tutto il movimento e che tali infrastrutture debbano essere incentivate nel modo pi&ugrave; decentralizzato e federato possibile.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troviamo che la formazione e l'autoformazione siano indispensibili e possibili solo con il coinvolgimento di tutt* anche nella gestione di una infrastruttura informatica.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Troviamo che, per la nostra attivit&agrave; e per la libert&agrave; di tutte e tutti, l'anonimato sia da difendere.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crediamo che sia importante che esista un mezzo capace di permettere, anche a chi ha poche competenze tecniche, di potersi esprimere senza che qualcuno lo possa facilmente identificare.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cosa vogliamo nel nostro social network<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poter conoscere gli algoritmi che definiscono i contenuti che appaiono nella nostra &ldquo;home&rdquo;.

Ich betreibe diese Instanz in meiner Freizeit als Darmstädter für andere Darmstädter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ich stehe im Kontakt zu anderen Hobby-Administratoren in ganz Deutschland um ein gesundes Netzwerk alternativer Social Media aufzubauen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Meine Grundidee ist es, eine Plattform für Darmstädter zu bieten auf der lokal-relevante Themen geteilt werden können. Durch die Architektur der Plattform, ist auch eine Kommunikation über Landes und Bundesgrenzen hinaus möglich. Meine Hoffnung an dieses Projekt ist, Menschen, Vereine, Verwaltung, lokale Bewegungen und Gruppen jeglicher Art zusammen zu bringen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Durch meine Erfahrung als CTO und System Administrator hoffe ich eine stabile Plattform betreiben zu können. Mittelfristig werde ich mit öffentlichen Institutionen wie der hda und TU Darmstadt kooperieren, um der Plattform gerecht bleiben zu können. Nichts desto trotz handelt es sich um ein Hobby-Projekt, weswegen ich keine Gewährleistungen geben kann. Dagegen kann ich Transparenz und pro-aktive Maßnahmen bieten und diese für mich sprechen lassen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Verbesserungsvorschläge nehme ich gerne an und Diskussionen stehe ich offen gegenüber.

The Local timeline is “Public” and moderated. This is a community for wargamers about wargaming and the Local timeline should reflect topics related to the hobby. We’ll interpret “related to the hobby” liberally to encourage discussion, but draw the line at posts dealing with contemporary sexuality, gender, politics, race, or religion that denigrate others, or are intended to polarize the community. If you’re not sure how a potential post will be received, be conservative and post it as “Unlisted” or “For followers”, or use content warnings. The server rules apply to all posts regardless of visibility. Please follow them. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Is it free?<\/h2>\n\n<p>It&#39;s free. One of appeals of Mastodon is that it&#39;s free of the data harvesting and monetization practices so common on the web today. If the operational costs become unmanageable, I&#39;ll bring it to the community and we can solve it together.    <\/p>\n\n<h2>Daily backups<\/h2>\n\n<p>Full daily backups are done nightly so you can have the confidence that an outage will not erase all of your data.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Redundant administration of the server infrastructure<\/h2>\n\n<p>A second administrator is on hand to mitigate the risk of a life event preventing me from administering the environment.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Commitment to 12 months of advance warning in case of shutting down<\/h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes services shut down, it is the cycle of life.

If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.<\/p>\n\n<p>We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication.

Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers&#8217; accounts.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address).<\/p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.<\/p>\n\n<p>The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Changes and amendments<\/h3>\n\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion.

When in doubt, err on the side of empathy, civility, and kindness.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Taking part in online interaction obliges the user to abide by current rules and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netiquette\">netiquette<\/a>.<\/h4>\n\n<p>On Mastodon, this includes using the <strong>CW<\/strong> function and the <strong>#NSFW<\/strong> hashtag, and choosing an appropriate level of public display for your posts. We  encourage our users to add alt text to their images to make our instance more inclusive for people with visual impairment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Media that contains violent or explicit imagery, or that could reasonably be assumed to be upsetting to an average person, should always be marked as sensitive.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Be considerate of other people.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Please remember what you say on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se<\/em> is public and can be seen by any person on the internet, many of whom have backgrounds and values that differ from yours; take a moment before posting and think about ways your message might be misunderstood. Likewise, remember that many things you read may be written by people with different values or from different backgrounds than yourself, and they might not have understood how their message could be read in a negative way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Racism, sexism, and hateful messages about sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, or any cultural, ethnic, caste, or religious identity or background are absolutely prohibited. <\/p>\n\n<h4>You may not use services hosted by ACC to violate another person&#39;s integrity.<\/h4>\n\n<p>This includes compiling and posting personal information about another person (&quot;doxxing&quot;), posting personal communications from a person without their permission, sending harassing or abusive messages, or coordinating harassment against other people (&quot;dogpiling&quot;).<\/p>\n\n<h4>Bot accounts and accounts that use excessive automated posting may be suspended or silenced if they&#39;re disruptive or degrade performance.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Please be considerate when programming your bots or using automatic posting services or applications, and use rate limiting and unlisted post visibility. You may also want to consider hosting your bot on a bot-friendly instance like <a href=\"https:\/\/botsin.space\/\">botsin.space<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Uncurated autoposters and newsbots posting from feed sources are not permitted.<\/p>\n\n<h4>You may not use services hosted by ACC for commercial purposes.<\/h4>\n\n<p>There&#39;s not always a clear line between personal and commercial activity, especially for people who work on a freelance basis in creative and technical fields. If your account is for personal social interaction with other people, even if you&#39;re talking to people who work in your industry or sharing the kind of work you also do professionally, it&#39;s probably fine.<\/p>\n\n<p>If your primary use for a Mastodon account is to advertise your products or services, post affiliate links, build your brand, connect with customers, or grow your audience, it&#39;s probably a commercial account and not allowed on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se<\/em>. If you need Mastodon for your business, why not <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mastodon\/mastodon\">run your own<\/a>? :)<\/p>\n\n<h4>If you see content which you believe is in breach of this code or our usage rules, please report it for review.<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re unsure whether something is a violation of our policies, but it feels questionable, please do report it.

By default this instance federates with all other Mastodon and Mastodon-compatible instances in the network. <\/p>\n\n<p>Federation limitations such as silencing or media rejection may be used when content from another server conflicts with what&#39;s allowed on our server. This is usually due to incompatibility between contant allowed on our instance and content allowed on theirs. You&#39;re still able to follow and communicate with users on a silenced instance, but their posts will not appear in the public timelines on <em>mastodon.acc.sunet.se<\/em>. Please exercise discretion when boosting posts from these instances.<\/p>\n\n<p>Full federation suspension is only implemented in cases of network-disrupting technical difficulties, or hostile or malicious activity. <\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, federation limitations or suspensions are made on a case by case basis and we do not employ any third party blocklists.<\/p>\n\n<p>A full list of instances with which we limit or suspend federation may found below under <strong>Moderated servers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re the admin of a server on the list, you can reach us via our contact email to let us know when your situation is resolved and it&#39;s safe to restore connection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last updated:

General Guidelines<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be welcoming<\/strong>. We strive to be a community that welcomes people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, neurodiversity, and physical ability.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be respectful<\/strong>. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Members of the Club should be respectful of each other and of other users in the Fediverse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Choose your words with care.<\/strong> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others or belittle their experiences.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it easy for others to moderate their experience<\/strong>. Liberally use Content Warnings, hashtags, and unlisted\/&quot;Followers Only&quot; posts so others can choose whether to engage with your content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>De-escalate<\/strong>. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Avoid microaggressions such as &quot;not all men,&quot; white\/man\/cis-splaining, knowingly using the wrong pronouns to address someone, posting about particular individuals without naming them (&quot;subtooting&quot;), and so on. If you make a mistake, apologize.<\/li>\n<li><strong>No Gate-Keeping<\/strong>. We love all kinds of music in the Club, including much that you may not love. Accept and celebrate that <em>we<\/em> love it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be friendly<\/strong>. Don&#39;t be a dick.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>2.

We will remove accounts that are not 18+ accordingly.<\/li>\n<li><em>Treat others with respect<\/em >, and be respectful in kind.<\/li>\n<li><em>No systemic abuse<\/em> such as sexism, racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, etc. When it comes to defining what constitutes \"systemic abuse\", the opinions of the marginalized are given priority at all times. <\/li>\n<li><em>No unfocused misandry<\/em>. This is due to its impact on non-binary, genderqueer, trans, disabled, PoC, queer, and otherwise marginalized men, several of whom are on our instance. Misandry focused at the top of the kyriarchy is not against the rules.<\/li>\n<li><em>No harassment<\/em >. Harassment campaigns may not be spread here, even against \"valid\" targets; this includes doxxing and dogpiling. If you must call someone out, do it elsewhere and link it here. <\/li>\n<li><em>No Quote Tooting<\/em>. On other social networks it's often used just to show off how horrible someone else is or to draw followers into an argument that should be one-on-one. Attempts to circumvent this through screencaps are prohibited. <\/li>\n<li><em>Don't give unsolicited advice<\/em> to others. Ask permission before making suggestions to folks.<\/li>\n<li><em>CW sexually explicit content<\/em> This includes images and text. All sexually explicit images must exclusively involve consent-capable adults. (\"Consent-capable\": If asked whether they'd like to pose for an adult photo, they would be capable of responding \"yes\", and that \"yes\" would be able to stand up in court of law.) <\/li>\n<li><em>No scraping content<\/em> from web interface or API.<\/li>\n<li><em>No public twitter crossposting<\/em> unless you're on beach city a lot reading and replying. If you are mostly crossposting and not reading, you may post unlisted.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\">\n<p><em>These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user&#39;s access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.<\/em><\/p><\/p>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\">\n<h3>Content Warnings<\/h3>\n<p>Content Warnings are a tool to enable someone to opt-into your content.  This is particularly useful when posting publicly, as opposed to unlisted. When you post publicly, your posts are received by people from this server and other servers that may not currently follow you.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#39;t want to deal with CWs, feel free to post unlisted! Unlisted posts work just like twitter and only go to your profile and followers and or people posts are boosted to.<\/p>\n<p>To use content warnings, click the CW button when composing your toots.  This will  hide the main body of your toot behind a line of text text like a subject line.<\/p>\n<p>Here at Beach City, sexually explicit content, graphically violent content, and similar are required to be CWed.  We heavily suggest you also CW the topics below as well. Topics can get fuzzy, so as long as you&#39;re not malicious with it, it&#39;s fine.<\/p><\/p>\n\n<p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sex and nudity<\/li>\n<li>Drugs, drug use<\/li>\n<li>Personal health, medical issues, hospitals<\/li>\n<li>Depression, anxiety, mental health issues, suicidal thoughts<\/li>\n<li>Food, weight loss, weight gain<\/li>\n<li>Death, funerals<\/li>\n<li>Violence of any kind<\/li>\n<li>Links to Facebook or Twitter<\/li>\n<li>Movie and TV show spoilers<\/li>\n<li>Selfies, eye contact<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are a number of other topics you might consider CWing, such as bigotry and politics, but this is something between you and your audience. It's okay to ask others to CW certain topics, but it's also okay to ignore requests for CWs.  People who do not like your CW choices can choose to mute or block you or use filters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Harassing users to CW their content, as well as demanding CWs from folks talking about their personal experiences of racism and other forms of bigotry, is against our rules and could result in being banned.<\/p>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\">\n<h3>Staff<\/h3><\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the site's owner, <a href=\"https:\/\/beach.city\/@pandora_parrot\">@pandora_parrot<\/a>, Beach.city's moderation staff include:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/beach.city\/@violetSpark\">@violetSpark<\/a>\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr class=\"spacer\">\n<h3>Our promise to you<\/h3>\n<p>We promise to do everything we can to avoid negatively impacting your social media experience. We will immediately block every single example of overt and explicit racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. We will be judicious about other forms of behavior we find unpleasant. We'll allow you to manage that yourselves, using your own personal block lists and mute lists. If you see a problem you think we need to act on as a server, report the user or toot that is a problem and we will act on it rapidly. We'll bias towards safety and act fast, but always be willing to step back from any mistakes we discover.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Beach City is our private beach-side sanctuary for close friends and awesome folks.

Recognizing the subjectivity of the matter, we consider this a recommendation rather than a hard rule, and we will approach any reports or complaints on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrative nudity and body\/anatomy studies with very visible genitalia, and titillating \/ erotic imagery intended for mature audiences  are allowed on bytetower.social, but &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;\/strong&gt; if tagged appropriately (ex. #NSFW, #nudity, #lewd, etc.) and marked as sensitive or placed under a descriptive content warning.\n   &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tags are required so people have the opportunity to filter such content from their timelines altogether.&lt;\/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;Descriptive text is required so that people can make an informed decision about whether to engage with the content below the cut\/image blur or not.&lt;\/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re unsure whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning, consider the following hypothetical questions: Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable viewing in a white collar work situation? Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable being viewed by a minor? Would you happily show it to your parents? A no to any of these questions may require it being CWed\/marked as sensitive. If you&#39;re still unsure, marking it as sensitive\/CWing it is a good bet.\n    &lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another way to decide whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning is to remember the &lt;strong&gt;Three B&#39;s&lt;\/strong&gt;: If your work features any &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;\/strong&gt;oobs, &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;\/strong&gt;utts, or &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;\/strong&gt;its (genitals), hide that sucker!&lt;\/li&gt;\n   &lt;\/ul&gt;\n   &lt;\/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;Loli or sexual content of questionable age is expressly prohibited — your account will be suspended. (This includes cub porn.) \n   &lt;\/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Nude photographs are only allowed if done in an artistic spirit — however, it still needs to be tagged and CWed\/marked as sensitive. Erotic photography, pornography, or photography that puts too much emphasis on the genitals is &lt;strong&gt;not allowed&lt;\/strong&gt;, even if marked &quot;Unlisted&quot;\/&quot;Followers Only&quot;.&lt;\/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;We understand that these things are subjective, but final interpretation of these rules are up to our moderation team. If in doubt, consider whether bytetower.social is the right place for this kind of sexual\/explicit work.&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p><\/p><\/li><li>Gore, vore, and blood violence must also be placed under a descriptive content warning or marked sensitive.<\/li><p><\/p>\n\n<p><\/p><li> No NFT content.

Boot drive is 2 WD SN700 NVMe 1TB drives in RAID-Z1 Its cluster data is synced every 10 minutes between 2 systems with Intel i7-12700t processors and 1 with an Intel i9-10900t with 64GB of DDR5 (DDR4 for the i9) per node.  The Virtual Environment is by ProxMox, with Enterprise Level update support.  The system is on a dedicated 30a circuit backed by UPS and 24kw whole building natural gas generator.  Soon, solar will be added.  Data is backed up to a RAID-6 array nightly and backed up to LTO6 tape weekly.  Tapes are cycled off-site every 3 months.  Our connection is a business class fiber 5Gbit symmetrical account with multiple static IPs through AT&amp;T.<\/p>\n\n<p>What this means is, if one of our servers dies, we lose a max of 10 minutes of data.  And the site is back up on another server within 10 seconds.  Your data is always backed-up, and barring planned downtime or upstream things out of our control, you will have a fast, reliable experience with tiggi.es.  The fact that we limit our users makes that even more beneficial.  When choosing an instance, please choose one that is open about their configuration and how they secure your data and maintain a high uptime.<\/p>\n\n<p>Donations: Please donate to your nearest animal shelter and post it. Helping real animals means more to us than helping pay for the setup. Thank you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data Security: Tiggi.es considers security and privacy to be of paramount importance.  In the event of any legal inquiry, Tiggi.es will require appropriate legal documents in order to share any data we have.  None of our data is stored on the cloud, or on systems not owned by Tiggi.es.  While there are references to remote instances and private messages stored, we trust no 3rd parties with your data. <\/p>\n","prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_nocw","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising","spoilers_nocw"]},"thumbnail":"https:\/\/tiggi.es\/system\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/002\/@1x\/5e5ff71a86a067a1.png"},{"info":{"full_description":"<p>This is a queer-friendly federated Mastodon instance. You may use it as a personal account, and jokes are definitely encouraged, but the focus is on academics. \n<p>\nReal names and credentials are encouraged so that everyone is clear about who is talking and where they are coming from; however, we understand that publicly posting with real names is less safe for some scholars than others, and so they are not required. IN GENERAL, this server is governed by norms (standards of behaviour which we want to uphold, and hold each other accountable for) rather than rules (requirements which are enforced with the threat of punishment).\n<p>\nIf you are new to Mastodon, you may find <A HREF=\"https:\/\/hcommons.org\/docs\/mastodon-quick-start-guide-for-humanities-scholars\/\">this guide<\/A> useful.

However, if you need to be told that proselytisation is not appropriate, then this is probably not the server for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<h1>Who is welcome on this server? Do I need to be a full-time student, teacher or researcher?<\/h1>\n<p>\nThe &quot;topic&quot; for this instance is the academic study of religion, broadly construed. You do not need an advanced degree to join (or any degree, for that matter).\n<p>\nIf you consider yourself a scholar of religion in any capacity, and you are willing to engage with others respectfully, and you will respect our community&#39;s efforts to make this a safe space for queer people and other minorities, you are absolutely welcome here.\n<p>\nThis instance was specifically started to provide a safe space for minorities in academia. Due to the antagonistic relationship that law enforcement has often had with these groups, police officers and employees of any law enforcement or intelligence agency are not welcome on this instance.\n<p>\n<h1>Institutional Accounts<\/h1>\n<p>\nAs Mastodon grows, more institutions, learned societies, research projects, and publications are seeking a home. We recognise that there is a large difference in the budgetary and technical capabilities of various entities, and that self-hosting is not an option for everyone. We will review requests for these accounts on a case-by-case basis, and are more likely to approve accounts for smaller learned societies and research projects where the timescale and budget make self-hosting impractical than for entire departments or societies large enough to employ their own staff. \n<p>\nIn order to permit proper moderation, we do require assurance that each account will be run by a single, named individual rather than shared amongst a group. In order to minimise the demand such accounts make on server capacity, we request that they run primarily as announcement accounts. We do request that societies which choose to make this instance their permanent home consider a small donation to hosting costs.\n<p>This policy is subject to periodic review as Mastodon grows and changes. Owners of institutional accounts will be consulted in advance of any changes which would result in their use being restricted.\n<p><\/p>\n\n<h1>Introduce yourself!<\/h1>\n\n<p><p>\nAfter signing up, post a message to the Local Timeline telling us who you are, what your academic interests are, and helping us to get to know you better. Please tag your post with #introduction. It&#39;s also useful to tag it with #Religidon so that the wider community of religion scholars on Mastodon can see it.\n<p><\/p>\n\n<h1>Content Warnings (CW's)<\/h1>\n\n<p><p>\nPlease add CW&#39;s (content warnings) that are accurate and descriptive enough to enable reader consent to the following types of posts:\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>rants,<\/li>\n<li>selfies,<\/li>\n<li>current events (includes: US or non-US, local, national, international, and should be applied regardless of whether sources are academic or non-partisan),\n<li>high-conflict or otherwise exhausting issues of popular debate (e.g. climate change, GMO&#39;s, privacy issues, elections, etc.),<\/li>\n<li>mentions of death or violence,<\/li>\n<li>references or links to Facebook\/Twitter\/other big tech companies,<\/li>\n<li>spoilers of popular and recent TV shows or other media,<\/li>\n<li>ASCII art (this one is important to ensure that someone using a screen reader doesn&#39;t have to listen to an attempt to read out a bunch of obscure symbols)<\/li>\n<li>stresses particular to academia such as grades, exams, thesis progress, academic job market prospects, and<\/li>\n<li>anything else where another user might want to decide for themselves whether or when they want to interact with your post.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In general, think of your posts not just as shouting out into the void, but as communication with real humans on the other side of the screen, and try to be considerate of those real humans. There is a setting in your preferences to open all posts with Content Warnings automatically, if you don&#39;t want to click through each one.\n<p><\/p>\n\n<h1>Image descriptions<\/h1>\n\n<p><p>\nIt is a norm on this instance that you add accurate descriptions to all images and video that you post to aid in accessibility. (A description like &quot;image.jpg&quot; that does not aid in accessibility would not meet this expectation.)\n<p>\nIf you post an image of a screenshot of text, it is a norm on this instance that you transcribe the text in the image description.\n<p>\n<h1>The Local Timeline<\/h1>\n<p>\nPosts on the Local Timeline (ones with the &quot;Public&quot; privacy setting) will be checked to ensure that Content Warnings are applied, images are described, and other norms are adhered to. Unlisted posts will not be proactively reviewed, but will still be subject to rules regarding abuse and other hate-speech.\n<p>\nNOTE: The &quot;official&quot; Mastodon app is NOT recommended for use on this instance, as it does not allow for posting using the &quot;Unlisted&quot; privacy setting.\n<p>\nConsider using a CW if you&#39;re not sure that your post is &quot;on-topic.&quot; This instance is not meant to be a current events news aggregator, and if your post seems to fall into this category, you are likely to receive a gentle request to delete and re-draft it with a CW or as an Unlisted post. Let&#39;s try to avoid turning the Local Timeline into the same rehashing of the outrage-of-the-day that we see on Twitter!\n<p>\nNot every post on the Local Timeline should be CW&#39;d, but most should. Do your best to try to accommodate each other, and try to be understanding when there is a clash of expectations or needs.\n<p><\/p>\n\n<h1>Unwelcome conduct<\/h1>\n\n<p><p>\nThe following will result in: a warning from the admin or having offending posts deleted, possibly without prior notice, depending on the severity of the issue.\n<ul>\n<li>Providing unsolicited advice to strangers (see exception below)<\/li>\n<li>Inappropriate un-CW&#39;d posts on the Local Timeline (see above for CW policies)<\/li>\n<li>Posts with un-described images or video<\/li>\n<li>Shortened links, e.g. bit.ly, t.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, ift.tt, lnkd.in, is.gd or t.co (These are considered malicious because link-shorteners track users without their consent and obscure the destination address, which also prevents users from being able to decide whether they want to visit the link beforehand)<\/li>\n<li>Advertisement or apologia for cryptocurrencies, NFT&#39;s, or multi-level marketing schemes. (This is the one that&#39;s most likely to lead to summary deletion.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\nExceptions:\n<ul>\n<li>DOI links (e.g. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.k959) are allowed but the post must accurately describe the title\/author\/journal to allow the reader to decide for themselves whether they would like to follow the link. (In cases of very long titles, you may truncate it, and in cases of long author lists, &quot;First-Author et al&quot; will do.) Posts with DOI links where the target of the link is not described, or not described sufficiently, may be deleted without warning.<\/li>\n<li>Unsolicited advice is allowed if its purpose is providing help to new users (e.g instructions on how to use CWs or image descriptions)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<h1>Things that will get your account closed, possibly without warning<\/h1>\n<p>\nThese are the things that are not open to negotiation.\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, able-ism, etc. (will result in a permanent ban, you may not receive a prior warning)<\/li>\n<li>Serious dishonesty that is hurtful to others (e.g. falsely representing oneself as a member of a minority; services offering to write academic papers to help students cheat; vaccine denialism; predatory conferences or journals; overt pseudoscience such as flat-earther-ism etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Anything that could be described as &quot;spam&quot;<\/li>\n<li>Impersonating other people<\/li>\n<li>Harassment of any kind. This includes heckling, sea-lioning, and continuing to push a &quot;robust debate&quot; past the point that the other party has indicated that they are done.<\/li>\n<li>No bots and no &quot;institutional&quot; accounts operated by non-members please; this instance is for people<\/li>\n<li>Tools that repeat a Twitter account must post as Unlisted, not Public. Mirroring Twitter must not be the sole purpose of an account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n\n<h1>Regarding attempts to abuse these anti-abuse tools and policies<\/h1>\n\n<p><p>\nDo not attempt to weaponize our Community Standards or anti-abuse tools\/policies against marginalized groups such as people of colour, women or queer people. Users are expected to have the literacy to understand that &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; is not real, and so attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken deliberately in bad-faith. (E.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CW&#39;s on every discussion of race; a straight person who reports a queer person for writing &quot;I hate straight people&quot; may find their own account suspended.) We recognise that the world is large, and there are indeed some contexts in which Christians do constitute a marginalised group, but Europe and North America are not among them.<\/p>\n\n<p><p><\/p>\n\n<p>More information may be found in our <A HREF=\"https:\/\/religion.masto.host\/terms\">Terms of Service<\/A>.<\/p>\n","prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","nudity_all","pornography_nocw","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising","spoilers_nocw"],"categories":["academia"],"languages":["en"],"short_description":"This is a Mastodon instance for scholars of religion (any tradition, methodology, or period)."},"name":"religion.masto.host","thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.masto.host\/religionmastohost\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/001\/@1x\/4e2a57717a07e394.png","users":"110","active_users":9},{"users":"109","name":"growers.social","info":{"languages":["en"],"categories":["humor","tech"],"full_description":"<center><h1>Welcome to Growers Social!<\/h1><\/center>\n\n<p>This server was primarily set up to be a home for all green thumbs.

Die Verwaltung und Moderation wird so neutral wie möglich gehandhabt<\/h4>\n\n<p>Berichte und weit verbreitete Informationen über bestimmte Vorfälle (oft als <strong>Bad Actors<\/strong> bezeichnet) werden überprüft und es werden gegebenenfalls Maßnahmen ergriffen.<\/p>\n\n<h4>2. Die ergriffenen Maßnahmen beschränken sich auf das Nötigste, um den Betrieb des Netzes aufrechtzuerhalten und die Fähigkeit der Nutzer der Instanzen, mit anderen Personen in Verbindung zu treten, nicht zu beeinträchtigen<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wenn eine andere Instanz Medieninhalte verbreitet, die für die Region, in der die aktuelle Instanz arbeitet, rechtlich fragwürdig sind\naus der die aktuelle Instanz arbeitet, können diese <strong>Dateien<\/strong> von der Speicherung ausgeschlossen werden.<\/li>\n<li>Wenn eine andere Instanz hasserfüllte Nachrichten verbreitet, die sich auf lokale Benutzer auswirken, kann in Erwägung gezogen werden, diese Instanz in den Timelines zu <strong>muten<\/strong> Wenn Nutzer der Zielinstanz folgen und\/oder folgen wollen können sie dies weiterhin tun.<\/li>\n<li>Wenn eine andere Instanz Inhalte veröffentlicht, die in der Region, in der die lokale Instanz arbeitet, illegal sind, oder aktiv Inhalte veröffentlicht\ndie lokale Benutzer angreifen, kann eine vollständige <strong>Instanzsperre<\/strong> das letzte Mittel sein.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4>3. Kommunikation vor Aktionen<\/h4>\n\n<p>Wenn eine der oben genannten Verhaltensweisen bei einer bestimmten Instanz auftritt, wird die Moderation der lokalen Instanz versuchen\ndie Moderation\/Administration dieser Instanz zu informieren und die Probleme von dort aus zu lösen. Nur wenn die Kommunikation nicht erfolgreich war oder keine Ergebnisse zur Lösung der Probleme erzielt wurden, werden Maßnahmen gegenüber dieser Instanz ergriffen.<\/p>\n\n<h4>4. Wir empfehlen keine Blocks<\/h4>\n\n<p>Blocklisten und Blockempfehlungen als Informationsquelle werden als selbstverständlich angesehen, sind aber nicht genau verifiziert. Anstatt diese Optionen zu nutzen, um Fälle von fragwürdigen Absichten öffentlich bekannt zu machen, werden wir die Nutzer vor Ort darüber informieren und sie an mögliche persönliche Optionen zum Ausblenden von Inhalten erinnern, die ihre Erfahrung mit dem Netzwerk beeinträchtigen könnten.<\/p>\n\n<h4>5. Keine Schuld durch Assoziation\/Verband<\/h4>\n\n<p>Wenn wir eine Maßnahme gegen Instanz X ergriffen haben, wird eine Instanz Y, die mit ihr föderiert ist, nicht mit demselben Urteil belegt werden. Eine natürliche Verbindung, wie sie durch das Design des Netzwerks gegeben ist, impliziert keine gemeinsamen Interessen und rechtfertigt daher nicht die gleichen Moderationsmethoden.<\/p>\n\n<p><hr \/>\n<p>Ungeachtet aller oben genannten Punkte kann die Instanzmoderation\/-verwaltung in besonderen Fällen immer noch beschließen, eine Instanz zu sperren.<\/p><\/p>\n\n<p><hr \/><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h1 id=&quot;fediverse-friendly-moderation-covenant&quot;&gt;Fediverse Friendly Moderation Covenant&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-instance-commits-to-the-following&quot;&gt;This instance commits to the following&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4 id=&quot;administration-and-moderation-will-be-handled-as-neutral-as-possible&quot;&gt;1.

Communication before Actions<\/h4>\n    <p>If any of the above behaviours start to surface from a given instance, the moderation of the local instance will attempt\nto inform the moderation\/administration of that instance and resolve the problems coming from there. Only if no communication succeeded or no results that resolved issues came forth, actions will be taken towards that instance.<\/p>\n    <h4 id=\"we-wont-recommend-blocks\">4. We won&#39;t recommend blocks<\/h4>\n    <p>Blocklists and block recommendations as an information source are taken for granted but lack accurate verification. Instead of using these options to publicly announce instances of questionable intent, we will inform local users of such, with the reminder of possible personal options for hiding content that might impact their experience of the network.<\/p>\n    <h4 id=\"no-guilt-by-associationfederation\">5. No Guilt-by-Association\/Federation<\/h4>\n    <p>If we have applied any action against Instance X, an Instance Y that federates with them will not get the same judgement applied to them. A natural connection, as by the networks design, does not imply shared interests and thus doesn&#39;t warrant the same moderation methods.<\/p>\n    <hr \/>\n    <p>Regardless of all given points above, in special cases the instance moderation\/administration might still opt to block\nan instance, while this is tried to be avoided at most.<\/p>\n    <hr \/>\n    <p>\n      <em>This Covenant is based on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pixeldesu\/fediverse-friendly-moderation-covenant\">The Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant<\/a> and is licensed under CC0<\/em>\n    <\/p><\/p>\n","prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","nudity_all","pornography_nocw","pornography_all","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising"],"categories":[],"short_description":"Deutsche Instanz mit dem Hang zum Verrückten.\r\nFür alle, die Wechseln wollen, steht meine Instanz frei zur Verfügung.

We have a few little LP-specific additions, but overall, the short of it is this; don&#39;t be an asshole, use content warnings liberally (this includes spoilers, gore, sex, nudity, etc, but also workaday stuff like politics, mental health, and multi-toot posts), and for the love of God, be kind. If you can&#39;t do that, we&#39;ll have no choice but to bust out the banhammer. And if you think asking you to put sensitive content behind a CW is encroaching on your free speech, well, tough shit. Also, and I say this emphatically, if you&#39;re a Nazi, a bigot, a TERF, a SWERF, a crypto huckster or otherwise a hate-peddler? Take a hike. We don&#39;t need or want you here.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also invite users of l.p to consider the user experience of everyone else here. It&#39;s not just a matter of etiquette, really.

So here it is,\na new instance. I hope many kind and thoughtful people on the internet will find a new home here.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n- Jeff\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Audience<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nThis instance is aimed at the general technology crowd. Topics often discussed here often include\nsoftware, hardware, firmware, shareware... Anything ending in -ware, really.\nFeel free to talk about $DAY_JOB, weekend hobbies, and anything in between.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf you're looking for more focus than all of technology (I know, right?), then feel free to pay attention to\nonline privacy and open source software in particular. That's where the instance name comes from.\nAdTech and the larger ecosystem of surveillance capitalism and the attention economy are a pox on all our houses.\nGladTech represents a kind of response to that pox. An antibody, if you will.\nDon't contribute to AdTech. Instead, contribute to software that makes people glad. Contribute to GladTech.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nDon't feel like you need to limit discussions to tech topics only though. Everyone needs a break\nfrom that now and then. Really, anyone who is willing to abide by the rules of conduct is welcome here,\nand their conversations are welcome too.\nIf you're looking for non-tech ideas, pictures of cats are almost always welcome! #caturday\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Customizations<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nGladtech.social uses a customized version of Mastodon!\n<\/p>\n\n<p>For now, I&#39;ve only made a few minor tweaks:\n<ul>\n    <li>Toots can be up to 2048 characters in length. Because powers of two are awesome!<\/li>\n    <li>The &quot;Publish&quot; button has been renamed back to &quot;Toot&quot;, because we all deserve a little whimsy in our lives.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut in the future, I might get a little more ambitious. I'm thinking about adding encryption\nto the DMs someday. But I'm not quite ready for that yet.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnyway, all the customizations for this instance can be found on the Codeberg account:\n<br>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/codeberg.org\/cuchazinteractive\/Mastodon\">https:\/\/codeberg.org\/cuchazinteractive\/Mastodon<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sustainability<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nAKA: Will this instance still be around X years from now?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nPredicting the future is hard, but here's some more information. Maybe that will help.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nRenting cloud resources to run the instance costs money, and Mastodon uses a lot of resources apparently.\nThe last time this section was updated (Dec 2022), the server had about 30 active users and a monthly cost of about\n27\/mo USD. The instance is running on a small self-managed virtual private \nserver (VPS) at the moment. It's about the least expensive way I can think to do it. At this level of cost,\nI'm happy to keep funding maintenance costs out-of-pocket. It costs about as much as a couple TV channel subscriptions.\nConsider it my donation to the fediverse.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSomeday though, if enough members hang out here, I might not be able to keep paying the bill personally.\nI don't yet know how big of a bill it will take to tap me out or how long it will take for the instance\nto grow that big, if ever. If that ever happens though, I'll open up the instance for donations from members.\nI've seen that model work well in other places, so we can consider that here if the time comes.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Rules of Conduct<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>No advertising or excessive promotion.<\/li>\n    <li>No bots, unless they're cute, funny, or useful. Bots should avoid posting to the public timeline.<\/li>\n    <li>No pornography.<\/li>\n    <li>No gore or graphic violence.<\/li>\n    <li>Content that is borderline NSFW or could be construed as NSFW at a glance should be put behind a CW (Content Warning).<\/li>\n    <li>No racism.<\/li>\n    <li>No sexism.<\/li>\n    <li>No discrimination based on gender, sexual minority, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or national origin.<\/li>\n    <li>No xenophobia, nationalism, casteism, or fascism; no sympathizing with or advocating for these things.<\/li>\n    <li>No sexual depictions of children.<\/li>\n    <li>No holocaust denialism, no Nazi symbolism, no promotion of National Socialism.<\/li>\n    <li>No stalking or harassment. In general, if someone asks you to stop interacting with them, then stop.<\/li>\n    <li>Stalking, harassment, hate speech, or doxing that is posted to other instances or on other social media platforms is still grounds for having your account terminated here.<\/li>\n    <li>No posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").<\/li>\n    <li>No unwelcome sexual attention.<\/li>\n    <li>No public or private oppressive language or actions.<\/li>\n    <li>No promotion of conspiracy theories (eg anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-COVID).<\/li>\n    <li>No unsolicited advice to strangers.<\/li>\n    <li>No advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.<\/li>\n    <li>No other unethical conduct.<\/li>\n    <li>No scraping content from web interface or API.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nTo protect the free speech of users belonging to marginalized groups, this instance does not federate with overtly\nfascist instances. Additionally, we will refuse to federate with instances that themselves choose to federate with fascist instances.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOur rules of conduct and instance block lists were forked from mastodon.technology,\nso a huge thanks to Ash and the moderation team there for sharing their great work with everyone!\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Handling harassment<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nIf you are being harassed, please report the user using the \"…\" button and then \"Report.\"\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf you engage in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe above rules may change at any time, and you may be banned at any time based on the moderators' judgment.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Privacy policy<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nWhat will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won't.\nHow will we aggregate your data in order to improve your service… none of that.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWe will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests, if it comes to that.\n(Hopefully it won't come to that!) Similarly, users and third parties are forbidden from scraping content from the\ninstance's web interface or API; you are required to respect robots.txt files.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nMore privacy information about this instance:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>HTTPS is used everywhere thanks to Let's Encrypt.<\/li>\n    <li>No ads or trackers.<\/li>\n    <li>Links are direct URLs rather than tracking redirects.<\/li>\n    <li>Understand though that this instance is run by a human administrator (Jeff), and (as is the case with all Mastodon servers)\n    that administrator potentially has access to your data, including DMs. The back-end is also not encrypted.\n    If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nAlso understand that Mastodon has no real privacy guarantees. Specifically, Mastodon does not offer end-to-end encryption (E2EE).\nMastodon is only really designed for communication in \"the public square\".\nIf, instead, you want to have private conversations, consider using an app with stronger privacy guarantees, like Signal.\n<\/p>\n","categories":["tech"],"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","nudity_all","pornography_nocw","pornography_all","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising"],"short_description":"This Mastodon instance is for people interested in technology, particularly online privacy and open source software.\r\nRefugees from mastodon.technology welcome!\r\nDiscussions aren't limited to technology though, because tech folks shouldn't be limited to technology either!","languages":["en"]},"thumbnail":"https:\/\/gladtech.social\/packs\/media\/images\/preview-6399aebd96ccf025654e2977454f168f.png","name":"gladtech.social"},{"info":{"full_description":"<h2>Worum es hier geht<\/h2>\n\n<p>no2nd.earth - der Name ist Programm<br\/>\nEs gibt keine zweite Erde.

This is a time to rededicate ourselves to care AND the courage necessary to pursue a different way of being in relation to each other.\"><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"larger\">This is a home base for relatively like-minded folks to land in the #TwitterMigration. <em>Likeminded, how?<\/em> In the middle of 2020, the world ground to a halt and was turned on its head. At that point, many were ready to admit that the systems running our world ==> are systems running humans (and this planet) into the ground. If you had that moment of reflection, the <strong>PostPandemicParty<\/strong> might be the homebase for you to land in.<\/p>\n\n<p>If can see that the society you live in was formed in the image of white supremacy, and is still steeped in it, then this might be the homebase for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you believe a multi-racial\/multi-ethnic democracy is ‘a more perfect union’ that we were dedicated to form (and that this is possible), that #BlackLivesMatter, that you're standing on #NativeLand, then this might be the homebase for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you believe in liberation more than charity or philanthropy, and would support oppressed people to lead the way to achieve their liberation, then this might be for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're sick and tired of [racism, settler colonialism, misogyny, religious extremism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism, anti-semitism, xenophobia], and of being sick &amp; tired, this might be the place for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you try to leave a better planet than you inherited, even if you know that the institution\/corporation\/academy where you work is steeped in a history of these oppressions, this might be for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're a human who believes in things like the above but also sometimes makes a human mistake, has messed up on a person's pronouns or said something ableist and apologized, or been called-in for an implicit bias you never examined before... and you are OK with becoming a better person and self-aware enough to learn from experiences, you might be home.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you grapple with these contradictions, because the human condition is messy, welcome.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"alpha50\">*It's not coincidence that we quote a Black woman and scholar above: BIPOC folks are listened to, uplifted in, and leaders of this Party.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"larger\">On this instance you might find professors, scholars, educators, digital humanists, human rights lawyers, ethicists, feminists, cartographers, designers, feminist cartographers and designers, archivists, librarians, poets, artists, activists, artist-activists, creative coders, public historians, museum professionals, organizers, journalists, archeologists, and a hundred other careers that people can hold. They might post about their projects, they might post links, they might post cute dog pics\/cat pics\/chinchilla pics, or they might post about a heck of a day they are having. There's no suggested \"on-topic\".<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rationale\">Rationale<\/h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\/tags\/twittermigration\">#TwitterMigration<\/a> won't happen all at once; it might ebb and flow as the tenor of Twitter degrades over time. Or maybe, it won't be as big an exodus as we thought. This instance was set up in October 2022 to be operational in case\/when people find the need to move some of their energies off that corporate platform.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, one doesn't need to move their life wholesale off Twitter. It's possible to still tweet at\/keep tabs on the Trending Topics &amp; politicians &amp; institutions of the world, while deciding that your personal posts (and quest for community) can be better served somewhere else.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are several Mastodon instances geared towards people in tech (octodon.social, fosstodon.org, indieweb.social, hachyderm.io, tech.lgbt). Scholar.social caters to academics, but discourages people from posting about their personal lives. Weirder.earth might be one I would pick. Yet I could not find a Mastodon instance that seemed home to folks who are politicized by the corruption of our governing systems, who advocate for structural change, and in so doing are already practicing respect for the diversity of humans who show up to the table.<\/p><p>This instance is called a Party in the sense of a Big Tent that covers people no matter what their specific interests are (cooking, birding, aerial arts, tech, data viz, maps, genealogy, higher ed, whatever!). But parties form around a value system that its members want to see in the world. We want to foster a community here that starts from a set of shared values.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"primer\">Quick Primer on Mastodon: You aren't just siloed on this community<\/h2>\n\n<p>Abridged from <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.help\/\">mastodon.help<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p>Mastodon is open-source software for letting microbloggers worldwide engage with each other, while being decentralized and noncommercial. Every instance has its own server, rules, admins, and moderation. <strong>So the social norms for posting vary locally across servers.<\/strong> The administrators on each instance are the ones who can block, mute or suspend accounts who violate their standards.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p class=\"larger\">Your Mastodon username will be in the format of <strong>@username@Instance<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p class=\"larger\"><strong>It really doesn't matter what Instance you register on<\/strong> if you are OK by their posting rules.<\/p><p>You can still Follow, Boost (≈retweet), DM, and reply to people the world over, because these servers are federated on a common protocol. (Think of your Instance as the area code of your phone number; your number can still call anyone else in the world.) If you want to change Instances in the future, it is possible to transfer all your data including toots (≈tweets), followers and blocked users list.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p><strong>However, there is one advantage within your Instance:<\/strong> Mastodon's UI provides a <u>Local Timeline<\/u> as well as your Federated Timeline. That means if you are embedded in a like-minded community, you are likely to discover interesting posts\/conversations\/links just within the Local feed, without the outside noise. Plus, the directory of users will be people you will probably find interesting. This also means that instances with 10K+ users are not necessarily BETTER — at that point, the noise is back in your Local feed and is not really much different than the Federated Timeline. So small &amp; medium-sized instances might actually be a better experience.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p>Mastodon's functionality is a lot <em>like<\/em> Twitter, but it is not the same. First, you get 500 characters, not 280. Second, your Feed is in chronological order; it is not manipulated by an algorithm. Mastodon has a Content Warning (CW) feature available with every post you make. It’s an optional mask that covers the content of your post with a warning message that you can customize.<\/p>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td width=\"20%\"><em>on Twitter<\/em><\/td><td width=\"20%\"><em>on Mastodon<\/em><\/td><td width=\"60%\">but...<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>Tweet<\/td><td>Toot<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>Retweet<\/td><td>Boost<\/td><td>but you can't Quote Tweet<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>Quote Tweet<\/td><td>—<\/td><td>To add your 2¢ you have to reply into the author's thread. This was a Mastodon design decision to foster real discussions, less-so talking <em>about<\/em> someone else.<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>Like<\/td><td>Favourite (Star)<\/td><td>but starring won't help it appear in your followers' feed<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>DMs<\/td><td>DMs<\/td><td>here it's really just a toot with the privacy set to 'Mentioned Person Only'. There's a separate tab for viewing them, but it's much less like an Inbox<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr><td>Elon Musk<\/td><td>No one owns it<\/td><td>it's open-source, and hence decentralized<\/td><\/tr>\n<\/tbody><\/table><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p><strong>Most importantly, Mastodon is NOT a direct Twitter-replacement.<\/strong> It's a social media platform to be home to its own discussions. You shouldn't use Mastodon just to echo\/post the stuff that outrages you on Twitter, and you are not rewarded here for the number of Stars (≈likes) or Boosts (≈retweets) you get. Just to know how many times a certain post was Boosted or favorited you must click on it; but there is no emphasis on it, and in fact, nobody really cares. Mastodon seems focused on having actual conversations about the topic you're posting about. See what other people reply, and add to your understanding of this crazy world we are in.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p><strong>The following mindsets from Twitter do not translate well here:<\/strong> The emotional\/social gratification in the # of retweets I get. Writing posts to get likes. Quote Tweeting to add my pile-on. What are the Trending Topics (imposing today’s obligatory pile-on)? Who should I follow?<\/p>\n<p><em>Instead on Mastodon:<\/em> Think ‘who would I interact with?’ Write posts that are interesting, to stimulate discussion and interaction.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"bubble\"><p>Finally, to be clear: never assume that there is 100% privacy in the Fediverse. Every Instance runs on a computer server, and the admins ultimately have the ability (even if not used) to examine everything stored on that server. If you think of your posts as a <em>postcard<\/em> you send through the digital mail, not a sealed envelope, then you should be okay. If you ever need true privacy, move your communications to another messaging platform like TXT, Signal, WhatApp, etc.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<h2 id=\"operations\">Server operations<\/h2>\n\n<p>This instance is hosted through <a href=\"https:\/\/masto.host\/\">Masto.host<\/a> on a server located in France. For the time being, the time and cost of operation is being paid by <a href=\"https:\/\/findauut.com\">auut studio<\/a> to jumpstart this home. As the community size grows, we may implement a way for users to contribute $1 toward costs, and to create a shared governance for moderation. Remember, any site that you want to stick around for the long haul is something you will probably need to contribute to. ‘Free’ services close shop all the time; or they are ‘free’ because you are paying the corporation with ownership of your data.<\/p>\n\n<p>The PostPandemicParty will federate with everything that doesn't support spam, hate speech, hateful ideology, negative or threatening behaviour, fascism and proto-fascism, extremism, or child pornography... we'll block all that shit to shield our users from hate. In short, we don't argue with people that Tubman would have shot.<\/p><p>We restrict the default visibility of posts coming from instances known for NSFW content, so that our users can use this instance at work. More information can be found in the section <a href=\"#unavailable-content\">Moderated Servers<\/a> below.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rules\">Server rules<\/h2>\n\n<p><img class=\"image tw-image\" src=\"https:\/\/findauut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tweet-normalize.png\" alt=\"screenshot of a tweet from @tonygoldmark on April 22, 2020 that reads in all-caps: NORMALIZE CHANGING YOUR OPINION WHEN PRESENTED WITH NEW INFORMATION\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Below is a summary of rules that govern the PostPandemicParty instance.

If you are feeling antagonistic, take a breather and log off. Come back and critique ideas, but not the person. Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) constitutes harassment. Unwelcome sexual attention (including sexualized comments or jokes) constitutes harassment.\n<\/div><\/li>\n<li><div class=\"rules-list__text\">\nThere's going to be zero tolerance for slurs or hateful language; racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes. You'll get banned.

Unmonitored bot accounts that post automatically are not acceptable.\n<\/div><\/li>\n<li><div class=\"rules-list__text\">\nDirect employees or contractors for any of the following types of organizations are not welcome here: Police, Immigration enforcement, State Intelligence\/Private investigation firms.

Geht das? Und obwohl es nicht geht, wie geht es nicht nicht? Diese Instanz ist Zettelkasten und Experimentierfeld.<\/p> \n\n<h3>Regeln<\/h3> \n\n<p>IfWO.eu ist eine Mastodon-Instanz und als solche ein Teil des Fediverse. IfWO.eu ist an der Möglichkeit des Austausches mit möglichst vielen anderen Instanzen interessiert. Um zu gewährleisten, dass ifwo.eu von anderen Instanzen nicht geblockt und stattdessen als vertrauenswürdige Instanz akzeptiert wird und damit sich die auf der Instanz etablierten Nutzenden wohl fühlen können, moderieren wir aktiv. Nazis, Antisemitismus, Islamfeindlichkeit und andere Formen von ätzendem Verhalten gegen Menschen werden nicht toleriert. Ausdrücklich willkommen sind hier Cyborgs, Non-Binary, LGBTQ, BIPoC. Neben dem \"Owner\" @sozialwelten gibt es zwei Moderatorinnen, die helfen, dass auf Meldungen immer schnell reagiert wird.<\/p> \n\n<h3>Geblockte Instanzen<\/h3> \n\n<p>Über mehrere Jahre hat der IfWO \"Owner\" @sozialwelten andere Instanzen restriktiv geblockt, insbesondere bei zwingendem und konkretem Anlass, wie der Verbreitung illegaler Inhalte und fehlende Maßnahmen der Instanz dagegen. Durch das Wachstum der Nutzendenzahlen des Fediverse im Verhältnis zu früheren Zeiten, die dadurch vermehrten Aktivitäten böswilliger Akteure, zur Absicherung der Verantwortlichkeiten der Administration der Instanz und durch die gestiegene Zahl an Nutzenden auf der IfWO.eu Plattform und deren Schutzinteressen wurden zusätzliche Maßnahmen notwendig. Neben Einzelfallentscheidungen verwendet @sozialwelten zwei sehr gängige Blocklisten fast vollständig: <a href=\"https:\/\/gardenfence.github.io\/\">Gardenfence<\/a> und fedinuke.txt von <a href=\"https:\/\/seirdy.one\/posts\/2023\/05\/02\/fediverse-blocklists\/\">Seirdy<\/a>. Instanzen für <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shitposting\">Shitposting<\/a> und NSFW-Postings, die im Hinblick auf problematische (illegale) Inhalte moderieren, werden nicht geblockt.<\/p> \n\n<h3>Anmeldung und Nutzung<\/h3>\n\n<p>Gerne würde @sozialwelten die Registrierung freigeben, nur leider melden sich dann zu viele (Crypto-Spam) Bots an. Aktuell muss daher jede Registrierung manuell freigeschaltet werden. @sozialwelten freut sich über eine kurze Begründung, hauptsächlich um auschließen zu können, dass es sich um einen Spamaccount handelt. In der Regel werden neue Accounts innerhalb von 24 Stunden zugelassen.<\/p> \n\n<h3>Was bislang geschah<\/h3> \n\n<p>Die Instanz diente @sozialwelten anfänglich, um eine persönliche Sammlung an Tröts zur dauerhaften Verfügbarkeit anzulegen. Über die Verwendung von Hashtags entstanden  dabei Verknüpfungen, womit Begriffe inhaltlich unterfüttert wurden. Thematisch handelte es sich um Notizen zu Lektüre, Gespräche und Begegnungen unter anderem aus den Feldern Soziologie, Sozialökonomie und Politik. Dieses spezifische Verhalten wird fortgesetzt, betrifft jedoch lediglich den Account von @sozialwelten. Andere Instanzen sind hiermit freundlich gebeten, die Instanz IfWO.eu nicht aufgrund dieses Verhaltens zu blocken. Mittlerweile haben sich auch andere Nutzende auf dieser Instanz angemeldet, aus Neugierde, wegen persönlicher Bekanntschaft oder auch eher zufällig, teils ohne Vorerfahrungen mit dem Fediverse. Im laufe der Zeit sind auch Nutzende abgeschalteter Instanzen dazu gekommen. IfWO.eu soll ein gut vernetzter und freundlicher Knotenpunkt im (insbesondere deutschsprachigen) Fediverse sein. Auf gute Nachbarschaft!<\/p> \n\n<h3>Unterstützung und Finanzierung<\/h3> \n\n<p>Es besteht die Möglichkeit, sich an der Finanzierung von IfWO zu beteiligen, indem man einen kleinen Obulus in einen Ko-Fi Hut wirft. Neben der Mastodon Instanz IfWO.eu gibt es aktuell auch noch <a href=\"https:\/\/peertube.ifwo.eu\">IfWO Peertube<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/element.ifwo.eu\">Matrix<\/a> und <a href=\"https:\/\/gitea.ifwo.eu\">Gitea<\/a>, die für etablierte Nutzende der IfWO Mastodon-Instanz zur Verfügung stehen. Alle Dienste im Zusammenhang mit IfWO bleiben unkommerziell - also ohne die Absicht Gewinne zu erzielen. <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/ifwo_eu\">Vielen Dank für Eure Unterstützung!<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Alles Weitere ist Learning By Doing.

Giving everyone some guidelines helps you all to know what&#39;s up and how we can keep this place an enjoyable, fun and interesting place to be.<\/p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s two parts:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rules<\/strong>: Things that are probably obvious to most people that are hurtful or unpleasant.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Etiquette<\/strong>: Things you might not be aware of that help keep the space awesome for everyone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Rules<\/h2>\n\n<p>This section covers stuff that is not okay to do here - generally because one way or another, it hurts or represses people.<\/p>\n\n<p>These may not cover every situation, so moderators can still make decisions at their own discretion.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>These apply to this instance and elsewhere on other instances, other social networks and IRL.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Your moderators will take any accusations seriously, and will handle them anonymously.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h3>Groups of people that aren&#39;t welcome here<\/h3>\n\n<p>If you have the following or similar kinds of ideologies or affiliations, you are not welcome here and you will be immediately banned if found out:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neo-fascism (White supremacy \/ White nationalism \/ Neo-nazi \/ Alt-right \/ Alt-light \/ Identitarian \/ Male supremacy \/ Manosphere)<\/li>\n<li>Reactionary (GamerGate \/ Anti-feminism \/ Neo-reactionary)<\/li>\n<li>Neo-feudalism (&#39;Anarcho&#39;-capitalism \/ &#39;Objectivism&#39; \/ Right-wing Libertarians)<\/li>\n<li>TERF, SWERF or otherwise anti-trans or anti-sex worker<\/li>\n<li>Truscum, Transmed or other kinds of identity policing.<\/li>\n<li>People who are generally phobic\/shitty towards non-binary genders.<\/li>\n<li>Religious fundamentalism or anti-abortion. (Other types of religion are A-OK!)<\/li>\n<li>Militarism, Chauvinism, Ethno-nationalism, Xenophobia or similar.<\/li>\n<li>Stalinism, Maoism or similar. (Non-authoritarian forms of Socialism and Communism are A-OK!)<\/li>\n<li>Shitty furries (Nazifurs and any furry that thinks being a bigoted piece of shit is okay!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you work in any capacity (whether as a direct employee or a contractor) for any of the following types of organisations, you aren&#39;t welcome here, and if you reveal yourself as such, you will be banned:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Police<\/li>\n<li>Immigration enforcement<\/li>\n<li>Intelligence\/spy organisations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>(This does not mean we will refuse <em>legally valid<\/em> requests for information, it just means that aside from this type of situation, you are not welcome here in any way.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Apart from those listed, if you have any ideology that believes in  - whether violently, non-violently or religiously - the repression of people based on race, gender identity, sexuality and so on, you are also not welcome here.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ideologies or affiliations based on controlled <em>counter-violence<\/em> in opposition to oppression (like antifa\/antifascism) <em>are<\/em> welcome here.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h3>Actions and behaviours that aren&#39;t welcome here<\/h3>\n\n<p>This covers a lot of mostly obviously unpleasant stuff.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Hate speech<\/h4>\n\n<p>Hate speech results in an immediate ban. Here are some examples of what we mean:<\/p>\n\n<p>Comments, imagery, memes or publications that demean, dehumanise, malign or otherwise hurt a person or a group of people based on certain characteristics or group status, including but not limited to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Race<\/li>\n<li>Sexuality<\/li>\n<li>Gender identity, including trans and non-binary gender identities<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Body size\/weight<\/li>\n<li>Disability<\/li>\n<li>Religion<\/li>\n<li>Sex work<\/li>\n<li>Kinks or fetishes<\/li>\n<li>Certain personas or forms of identity (furries, otherkin, plural systems, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Poverty\/lack of wealth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Saying things or things in a particular way, like:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Racial slurs, ableist slurs, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Intentional misgendering (intentionally using pronouns or phrasing to refer to someone&#39;s gender incorrectly)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It&#39;s okay to criticise things like religions, but only as long as that isn&#39;t just a wedge\/shield for bigotry (eg. using feminist concepts to malign all forms of Islam instead of rationally talking about the specific forms of Islam or Islamic communities which do have mysogyny issues).<\/p>\n\n<p>Marginalised communities (like PoC or women) being fed up with systemic problems and complaining about certain groups&#39; lack of understanding or action about certain issues (ie. white people, men) is not hate speech. If you&#39;re not a part of the problem, you don&#39;t need to see it as an attack. :)<\/p>\n\n<h4>Generally unacceptable behaviour<\/h4>\n\n<p>These result in an immediate ban:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly being disrespectful or acting like an asshole.<\/li>\n<li>Telling someone to or suggesting that someone should commit suicide, be killed, or die. (even jokingly)<\/li>\n<li>Refusing to CW content that should be in a CW (see the Etiquette section), or refusing moderator requests to CW content.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising or preaching (promoting your own work is fine; being paid to shill\/advertise for someone else is not fine)<\/li>\n<li>Making sex jokes or flirting with someone when they haven&#39;t specifically said that&#39;s okay on their profile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4>Harassment and Threats<\/h4>\n\n<p>Any of these kinds of things will result in an immediate ban:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Intentionally sending posts to someone that are designed to distress or insult them.<\/li>\n<li>Using posts, screenshots or out of context quotes to mock or make fun of someone else.<\/li>\n<li>Submitting false reports against someone else.<\/li>\n<li>Continuing to interact with someone after they have told you to stop.<\/li>\n<li>Threatening to harrass, threatening to dox, threatening to DDoS, or any other kind of threat.<\/li>\n<li>Sexual harassment or acting in a sexually predatory way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4>Conspiracy theories, pseudoscience and scams<\/h4>\n\n<p>It&#39;s important that our server is a place for constructive ideas, and not ones that are used as weapons, tools of disinformation, or spreading information that can cause harm.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some kinds of conspiracy talk and discussions of the occult and woo are fine, but these are examples of the kinds of things that are unacceptable here:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Anti-vaxxer<\/li>\n<li>COVID denial\/doomerism: ideologies normalizing the spread of COVID, rejecting risk mitigation such as masking and testing, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Climate change denial<\/li>\n<li>Flat earthers<\/li>\n<li>NWO, Illuminati, Chemtrails, Pizzagate, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Hate group conspiracy theories like Holocaust Denial.<\/li>\n<li>Pseudoscience like Homeopathy, &#39;healing crystals&#39;, etc.<\/li>\n<li>&#39;Creation Science&#39; and other religious forms of pseudoscience.<\/li>\n<li>Promoting MLMs (Multi-Level Marketing schemes) or Ponzi schemes.<\/li>\n<li>Promoting, supporting, or using this instance to do business with cryptocurrency, NFTs, play-to-earn gaming, or the like. (Anti-cryptocurrency posting is permitted.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Guerilla ontologies and similar things are absolutely fine.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Sexual content involving minors<\/h4>\n\n<p>Do not flirt with someone who is under 18.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do not post illustrated imagery featuring sexualised depictions <em>of people who appear to be underage<\/em>. Even if there&#39;s something saying they are over 18, they should <em>reasonably look like they are over 18<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do not post erotica involving minors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Child porn is absolutely not allowed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any of these will result in an immediate ban.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Etiquette<\/h2>\n\n<p>These are general things to be aware of if you use our instance. You may not be used to them, and that&#39;s okay! We&#39;re willing to help you if you stumble along the way.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a moderator asks you to repost something with a CW or asks you to change or delete a post for a particular reason outlined in this section, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re in trouble. You&#39;re just being given a friendly pointer so you can help make this space awesome for everyone 😄.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Local Timeline<\/h3>\n\n<p><em>(Mastodon has different &#39;timelines&#39; that different people can see - the Local Timeline is a timeline everyone in this instance can see. You post to it by choosing &#39;Public&#39; (the globe icon) in your post toolbar.)<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>We really want our Local Timeline to be an antidote to traditional social media posting; a more down to earth place where people talk about themselves and what they&#39;re up to.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Let everyone have space to share things. Be selective about your Local posts and avoid posting too many things at once.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid posting lots of external links on the local timeline. We want everyone to share things about <em>themselves<\/em>, and reposting stuff from elsewhere can make the space feel impersonal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Use CWs for sensitive content.<\/h3>\n\n<p>CWs (Content Warnings or Content Wrappers) are a really cool way for people to keep climate control over their Mastodon browsing experience. It&#39;s especially useful in these stressful times, but it&#39;s also useful if you or other people have particular mental health conditions or are just having a bad day.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should CW a post when it contains any of the following topics, whether the content is good or bad. Feel free to add (+) for positive content, (~) for mixed content and (-) for negative content.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Political current events<\/strong> such as elections and government actions (normally abbreviated to &#39;pol&#39; along with the country\/region, ie. &#39;UKpol&#39;, &#39;DEpol&#39;, etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Potentially triggering Mental Health topics<\/strong> (normally abbreviated to &#39;mh&#39;). <em>Many of our members come here to discuss their mental health journey, and we seek to be as welcoming and open as possible, but for the sake of other users: please CW references to self harm, suicide, helplessness and other moods and behaviours that may be contagious or trigger people in recovery<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Alcohol (&#39;alc&#39;) and drugs<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Diet talk or weight loss<\/strong> Discussion of dieting, including any judgments about &quot;healthy food&quot; even if you&#39;re not counting calories, should be CW&#39;d differently from &quot;ooh yummy&quot; types of food posts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Food in general<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Sexual themes or content<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Violent themes or content, blood and gore<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Themes or content about abuse<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Common phobias<\/strong> (Like certain animals such as snakes and insects.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Long posts or posts with multiple parts<\/strong> (please also use the &#39;unlisted&#39; privacy setting for posts after the first in a thread, so that the local timeline doesn&#39;t get flooded)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Also CW images that have nudity or these areas of the body exposed:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A certain area around the nipples (and\/or the nipples themselves). From the end of the ribcage to the bust line.<\/li>\n<li>Anything less than what boxer briefs or shorts would cover around the groin area.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This applies to all bodies regardless of gender.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>We don&#39;t want to ask anyone to CW their identities. We particularly don&#39;t want to ask marginalized people to CW their marginalization.<\/strong> We&#39;re not going to be hardline about the rules in cases where there are compelling reasons to frame what you&#39;re saying differently...<\/p>\n\n<p>...but &quot;this is important, so I won&#39;t CW&quot; and &quot;this is urgent, so I won&#39;t CW&quot; are non-sequiturs - the importance and the urgency have nothing to do with whether that content is more accessible with a content warning.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Always write descriptions for your images.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Mastodon has an image description feature, meaning that you can attach text descriptions to the images you upload so the blind or visually impaired can understand what the image is.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is never a time that this would not be potentially useful to someone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some tips for writing image descriptions:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Write:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Placement of objects<\/li>\n<li>The kind of image it is (photo, painting, drawing, CG, chart, text, screenshot etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Colours<\/li>\n<li>People and animals<\/li>\n<li>Placement of text<\/li>\n<li>Emotions (ie. smiling)<\/li>\n<li>General surroundings)<\/li>\n<li>(Generally what is important to understanding the picture, or what the point of the picture is.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t write:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Descriptions that are too detailed.<\/li>\n<li>Details of the picture that would be obvious in the given context (like, you don&#39;t need to say that a face has two eyes, a nose and a mouth because you&#39;ve said it&#39;s a face).<\/li>\n<li>Details that aren&#39;t the point or the focus of the picture.<\/li>\n<li>(Generally what isn&#39;t important to understanding the picture, or what the point of the picture is.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, not all mobile apps do image descriptions, but just try your best!<\/p>\n\n<h3>Be explicit about region-specific posts.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that Mastodon has users from all over the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have a post (like advice or politics) that&#39;s only relevant to a certain part of the world, mention what part of the world it is for.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Avoid subtooting when you can.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Subtooting (like subtweeting) is talking about something someone else has said without talking to the person who said it directly.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a tempting thing to do (and sometimes an ideal thing to do) if you don&#39;t want to get into a particular situation, but it has a negative side effect if you&#39;re not careful. It can make the entire environment hostile because subtooting can make people unsure whether you might be talking about them or not.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Be careful when considering giving unsolicited advice.<\/h3>\n\n<p>We try to be respectful of the opinions and views of others. Often unsolicited advice or prosletyzing, while well intentioned, can never the less make a person feel like their beliefs, values, or experience are invalid. For this reason, you should err on the side of caution.<\/p>\n\n<h3>If you see something bad, tell your moderator(s).<\/h3>\n\n<p>Corporate social media like Twitter and Tumblr can often make people feel powerless to actually take people who behave badly out of the picture, and this can lead to an ecosystem where issues are taken out publicly, and they can create mobs that cause a lot of people stress and can also easily harm the wrong people.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here, you have moderators who are willing and able to help you and investigate and deal with problems. Please don&#39;t post publicly about these issues, make a report or DM one of your local moderators.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Leave edgy humour and societal baggage at the door.<\/h3>\n\n<p>There are things you might be used to doing that you think are okay, but they actually hurt other people or make them feel unwelcome. <\/p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll need to keep in mind that these are not okay and you shouldn&#39;t do these kinds of things if you decide to make an account here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rape jokes<\/li>\n<li>Making jokes at the expense of content warnings (&#39;triggered&#39; jokes).<\/li>\n<li>Putting marginalised people in the position of having to defend or explain their marginalisation. It&#39;s <em>your<\/em> responsibility to do your own research.<\/li>\n<li>Microaggressions (<a href=\"https:\/\/rationalwiki.org\/wiki\/Microaggression\">you can find some examples of what that kind of thing is here<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Using phrases similar to &#39;not all men...&#39; when someone is just venting about something they&#39;ve experienced. If you&#39;re not a part of the problem, then you don&#39;t need to see it as a personal attack.<\/li>\n<li>Not using CWs properly (see the CW section above for guidance).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll help you if you genuinely make mistakes along the way, but please really try to keep them in mind.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Credits<\/h1>\n\n<p>These Rules and Etiquette are <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/weirderearth\/weirder-rules\/\">originally by weirder.earth<\/a>, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

While hosting a Mastodon party may sound like a fun proposition, it attracts many people to these open servers. Most users need to realize that no big company is paying the bills and putting in the work to maintain and update the software; they grew up on Facebook and Twitter, so the thought does not even cross their minds. More users mean more computer resources. Every system has its limits, and speed, or lack thereof, is the first thing you notice missing on popular servers. <br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>I like the services I use to be fast, something significant company-backed propositions like Twitter and Facebook have no problem delivering. However, speed is not guaranteed in the Mastodon federation realm of servers, so I am hosting my server with the hardware it needs to be performant.<br><br><be><\/p>\n\n<h2>Reliability<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some of these servers may vanish at any moment in time. Some may grow beyond the ability to administrate the Linux platform and keep fresh backups on hand, or the owner may eventually be unable or unwilling to pay for hardware and electricity bills. <br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Should you join my server https:\/\/mrnet.pt? Unless you are not bothered to have your account data lost and committed to a DNS domain I own (for as long as I keep paying for it), the answer should be &quot;no&quot;. I have no idea if I will want to keep this server for a few days or a lifetime. However, if you want to see how Mastodon works, with no pre-conceived expectations on how long you will be able to use this server of mine, just testing the waters... let me know, and I&#39;ll send you an invite. <br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>Sounds like a precarious investment of your time in social media?<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>The bad news is that the same goes for every other Mastodon server out there! Unlike big-tech-based social media sites, we are talking about volunteers, private individuals footing the bills and their own time. Make of it what you want, but I needed to ensure the fate of my Mastodon account was in my hands.<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>If you decide to join my Mastodon instance, let me tell you that I may take it down to use the computer for a few hours for something else. See, my hardware, my electricity, no commitment to your needs. If you&#39;re okay with &quot;it will be available to you when it&#39;s available to me&quot; then great, have fun.<br><br><be><\/p>\n\n<h2>Curiosity<\/h2>\n\n<p>I am a geek. I like technology. Looking at the Mastodon server side of things is fun for me. Yes, it will be a pain to maintain over time, there will be downtime episodes, and none of that bothers me. But, quite the opposite, it looks like a great hobby for those rainy days.<br><br><\/p>\n\n<p>I dislike Ruby on rails with a passion.

Mastodon is different. \n        It is diverse ecosystem consisting of multiple servers hosting user profiles which are connected to each other.\n        Like email, you can choose your provider and even switch it from the settings later on if you wish. \n        If you aren&#39;t happy with any provider, you can even install your own server and set your own rules. \n        Mastodon lets you control your data!\n    &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How&#39;s jako.social different from other Mastodon instances?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Traditional social media makes money by forcing users to give up their data if they want \n    to access that platform and they often rely on that. Mastodon tries to be different, but \n    without ad revenue, how can an instance survive? Most instances pay their server bills \n    using donations which they depend on. This makes it almost impossible to be sure which instance\n    will receive enough donations to keep it alive for the next year.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Jako.social is funded using web monetization protocol, which aims to be more sustainable than just\n    donations, so the hosting bill is paid by our users and backed up by @jimbo@jako.social. Therefore there is\n    no pressure for data collection or advertising, since there are no shareholders or no reason to make this profitable,\n    the main goal is just to get enough income to keep the servers running. No more or no less. If there ever happened \n    to be more income than needed, it  will be donated towards the development of Mastodon or Pixelfed.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Using web monetization on Jako.social is optional.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What&#39;s web monetization?&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Web monetization is a way to fund websites without collecting\n    excessive amounts of user data. In practice it requires just a browser extension, which sends tiny\n    fractions per second of chosen currency to any website which is currently active, on some websites, you may get ad free experience\n    other premium features. At the time of writing, the expenses are limited to 5$\/month\/user and there are no other expenses for the user\n    on Coil.com which is the creator of this protocol.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Web monetization is different from direct donation, since with web monetization the website you spend the \n    most time on will get the highest split of the monthly five dollars, and you as the user will receive the \n    benefits on every web monetization enabled website. On Jako.social, we consider it as a donation, but \n    instead of fixed donation amount, we have to &quot;earn&quot; the donation by providing reliable service, web monetization\n    only works when the website is working.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    But as mentioned earlier, using this is optional. However to our knowledge this is the only\n    Mastodon instance supporting web monetization at the moment if you happen to already be web monetization user.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/coil.com\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;button&gt;Read more about web monetization from Coil.com&lt;\/button&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    The web monetization is implemented using NGINX \n    injection to the html so no source code is modified and no scripts are added.\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Who is this server for?&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    This server is&#39;t focused into any specific topic\n&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;\/h2&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>More details can available by clicking the list items.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;details&gt;\n            &lt;summary&gt;The content posted on this server must comply with Finnish law!&lt;\/summary&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Our moderators are humans and we rather be safe than sorry when it comes to edge cases related to law&lt;\/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Selling or marketing of drugs or teaching how to make them may result in moderation actions like limitations even if the content is legal in Finland for safety reasons&lt;\/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Selling or marketing of weapons or teaching how to make them is prohibited&lt;\/li&gt;\n            &lt;\/ul&gt;\n        &lt;\/details&gt;\n    &lt;\/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;details&gt;\n            &lt;summary&gt;No spamming or mass advertising&lt;\/summary&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;\n                    Please contact admins before setting up a bot\n                &lt;\/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        Profiles belonging to different entities (like corporations, organizations) with no content and no profile picture and profiles with primarily advertisements will be silenced or shut down per case basis.

Dementsprechend werden die Nachrichten automatisiert anhand einer willkürlich gepflegten Liste wichtiger Begriffe (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Cymaphore\/orfodon-service\/blob\/master\/hashtags\">in Github einsehbar<\/a>) mit zusätzlichen Hashtags versehen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Diese können dann unter anderem direkt zur Suche nach weiteren Beiträgen verwendet werden, z.B.: <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Feuerwehr\"><code>#_Feuerwehr<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_WKStA\"><code>#_WKStA<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Wolf\"><code>#_Wolf<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_IT\"><code>#_IT<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Fu%C3%9FballBLG\"><code>#_FußballBLG<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Europawahl\"><code>#_Europawahl<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Wien\"><code>#_Wien<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Klimaschutz\"><code>#_Klimaschutz<\/code><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/_Deutschland\"><code>#_Deutschland<\/code><\/a>, ...<\/p>\n\n<h2>Warum haben die Hashtags einen Unterstrich am Anfang (#_Beispiel)?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Das Fediverse ist ein soziales Netzwerk von Menschen für Menschen. Die Beiträge bei ORFodon werden automatisiert erstellt und kommen in hoher Frequenz.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hierdurch wurden in der Vergangenheit viele normale Hashtags (z.B. <a href=\"https:\/\/orfodon.org\/tags\/Wien\"><code>#Wien<\/code><\/a>) mit Nachrichten regelrecht überflutet und die Beiträge echter Menschen verdrängt. Um den echten Benutzern &quot;Vorrang&quot; zu geben ohne die Vorteile von Hashtags zu verlieren, wurde diese Lösung gewählt und die Hashtag-Generierung entsprechend geändert.<\/p>\n\n<p>Das hat Nachteiile bei der Auffindbarkeit, Reichweite und Sichtbarkeit, aber es ist Rücksichtsvoller gegenüber der Allgemeinheit.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Funktionsweise<\/h1>\n\n<p>Ein Service-Script holt in regelmäßigen Abständen die RSS-Feeds des ORF ab und bereitet diese auf.

To stop seeing posts from someone, you have the ability to filter them, mute them, or block them completely. To limit the ability for you to be targeted, you have the options of opting out of discovery, hiding your social graph, or making your profile private.

The intended use of this feature is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and\/or potentially harmful topics without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though it may be used for many other things.<\/p>\n\n<p>Images can be marked as sensitive; this is a feature which hides an image until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning automatically marks the toot&#39;s images as sensitive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clearly communicated and accurately labeled content warnings and sensitive image settings are required when having public conversations involving any of the following topics or content:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sexual or Adult content<\/li>\n<li>Detailed descriptions of harassment as outlined above in the definitions of harassment<\/li>\n<li>Political Commentary of any kind<\/li>\n<li>Drugs or Drug Use<\/li>\n<li>Advertisements for Corporations<\/li>\n<li>&quot;Rage&quot; toots and Toots using exclusively capital letters<\/li>\n<li>Excessively Long Toots (longer than ~15-20 lines)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In general, think about if what you are posting could cause people distress.

Welcome to misfittoys.social, a microblogging Fediverse instance operated by a member of the LGBTQ+ community who struggles with mental health issues and who values compassion, respect, and freedom.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me share with you my vision for this lowly little Mastodon instance. I picture a place where we all strive to be respectful of each other and offer compassion and solace to one another. None of us are perfect, and we all make mistakes or say things we might’ve phrased a little differently given the chance. I’m not looking to cancel anyone; but I’m also not looking to coddle fascism cloaked in patriotism, unbridled capitalism, intolerance, or disrespect. Just follow the rules and most importantly <em>don’t feed the trolls.<\/em> This is a “living document”, and is subject to revision at any time.<\/p>\n\n<h2><em>If:<\/em><\/h2>\n\n<p>I suppose I should describe the type of candidate I seek to join me on this journey. Maybe something like this: If you&#39;ve ever felt like an outsider, or you don&#39;t belong, or that you don&#39;t fit in, or can&#39;t be your true self; if you&#39;ve sensed that your best is never really good enough, or that it&#39;s never going to actually &quot;get better&quot;; if you&#39;re appalled by the stunning lack of equality, empathy, and inclusion of our society; if you believe that everyone should be allowed to have a meaningful, fulfilling, reasonable quality of life; if you&#39;re certain that every person&#39;s worth should be determined by more than just their ability (or lack thereof) to earn monetary income; if you run out of spoons way too early, if you get burned out way too fast, or get hurt far too easily; if you&#39;re filled with wonder during those brief glimpses out of depression or pain or adversity; if you feel heartbreak every time someone tells you to &quot;just choose to be happy&quot;; if you struggle just to stay alive; <strong><em>if you relate to all of these things, or some of these things, or none of these things, but are capable of showing love, kindness and compassion to your fellow users, then you’re the type of person I’m looking for.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>tldr;(<em>too long didn&#39;t read<\/em>)? I wish to make friends with LGBTQIA+, marginalized BIPOC, the disenfranchised, the downtrodden. I need to network with people who are tactful and champion kindness, compassion, and the dignity of others. I seek people who approach mutual aid with respect and empathy rather than dismissiveness or derision.<\/p>\n\n<h3><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Still tldr;? If you’re a misfit with a kind heart, smash the sign-up button.<\/span><\/em><\/h3>\n\n<h2>Freedom of Speech<\/h2>\n\n<p>As a U.S. citizen, I believe in and support freedom of speech. But I also believe that free speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences. I also comprehend that the first amendment is referring to government overreach. At this time, this is a private server owned by a private person. Just like Twitter, Facebook, even AOL or CompuServe are free to suspend or deny service to users who abuse the rules, I will not hesitate to enforce the rules.

Be excellent!<BR>\nGeen discriminatie of aanzetten tot haat.<BR>\nGeen verspreiding van complottheorieën.<BR>\nGeen verspreiding van pornografie.<BR>\nGeen verspreiding van materiaal dat illegaal is.<BR>\n<BR><BR><\/p>\n\n<p>mastodon.mfbfreaks.nl is een Nederlandstalige server, onderdeel van het Mastodon sociale netwerk.<BR>\nEen proef van mfbfreaks.nl voor liefhebbers van mfb, of (philips) audio in het algemeen. Maak dus geen referrers of linkjes naar hatelijke, politieke, sexistische of racistische inhoud (de admin oordeelt zelf) Doe geen dingen die illegaal zijn, en ook geen reclame of spam.<BR><BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Doel hiervan is om een alternatief te geven voor het forum van de website, je kunt het hier dus prima over philips, mfb, audio, hifi en andere zaken hebben.\nUiteraard kun je ook leuke dingen van elders op het Internet hier met elkaar delen.<BR>\n<BR>\nHoe gaat het in zijn werk?<BR>\nMastodon is in het algemeen een sociaal netwerk bestaand uit steeds meer servers. Het lijkt een beetje op Facebook, Twitter, en Google Plus want je kunt berichten delen met tekst, video&#39;s en foto&#39;s; en je kunt mensen volgen. Ook kun je bepalen waar, of aan wie, een bericht zichtbaar mag zijn. Het bijzondere is dat er geen centrale website is die alles bepaalt zoals bijvoorbeeld bij Twitter, Facebook. De duizenden servers waaruit het Mastodon netwerk is opgebouwd zijn namelijk onafhankelijke servers die gezamelijk dit netwerk vormen.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Tijdlijnen<BR>\nDe &quot;Start&quot; pagina toont berichten van mensen die je volgt en je kunt met een mastodon-account op deze server mensen vanuit het werdeldwijde Mastodon netwerk volgen.<BR>\nDus als je iemand tegenkomt of kent met een account op een Mastodon server, onafhankelijk welke server, hoef je dus geen extra account te maken want je kunt een ieder vanuit hier volgen!<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Mastodon is dus een &quot;decentraal&quot; open netwerk, te vergelijken met e-mail, blogs, podcasts, en andere open systemen. Je keuze voor deze mastodonserver is net zoals je zelf kiest waar je jouw e-mail account aanmaakt, en bijvoorbeeld welke website of welk programma je gebruikt om e-mail te lezen. \nEr bestaan in de appstore dan ook diverse programma&#39;s\/apps waarmee je Mastodon kunt krijgen op je telefoon, deze zijn op dit moment allemaal server onafhankelijk. Je hoeft echter niet perse een handige app te installeren, hier online inloggen kan ook namelijk.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>De &quot;Lokaal&quot; pagina toont berichten die &quot;openbaar&quot; zijn, gedeeld door mensen vanaf mastodon.mfbfreaks.nl. Dit is een beetje te vergelijken ons forum, want alleen onze eigen leden \/ accounts dragen bij aan wat hierin staat. En onze lokale beheerder(s) zullen indien nodig spam verwijderen of andere regels handhaven.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>De &quot;Globaal&quot; pagina toont berichten vanuit het grotere Mastodon netwerk, inclusief van de duizenden andere servers, en soms ook in andere landen en talen. Dit is een beetje te vergelijken met een zoekmachine. Net als met zoekmachines, is elke zoekmachine anders. Onze &quot;Globaal&quot; pagina toont voornamelijk berichten van Mastodon servers waar één of meerdere van onze gebruikers mee in aanraking zijn gekomen. Je kunt, indien nodig, zo&#39;n server rapporteren want mocht er ongewenst gedrag vertoond worden, kan deze geblokkeerd worden.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Wanneer je op een hash-tag klikt, kom je automatisch op de Globaal pagina uit, met de hash-tag als zoekopgave. Zo kun je bijvoorbeeld nieuws, muziek, of andere interessante berichten Of personen ontdekken.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Berichten tooten: zichtbaarheid\nEen Mastodonbericht wordt ook wel een toot genoemd. Voordat je een bericht plaatst, kun je de zichtbaarheid bepalen.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Openbaar Overall zichtbaar.<BR>\nIn Lokaal, Globaal, in zoekresultaten, op je profiel, en voor volgers op hun Start pagina. <BR>\n<BR>\nMinder openbaar: (unlisted)<BR>\nZichtbaar op je profiel, voor volgers op hun Start. In principe voor iedereen toegankelijk wanneer ze een link krijgen, bijvoorbeeld wanneer het via-via met hen is gedeeld. Niet in zoekresultaten. Niet in Lokaal\/Globaal.<BR>\n<BR>\nAlleen volgers:<BR>\nAlleen toegankelijk voor je volgers, getoond op hun Start.<BR>\n<BR>\nDirect:<BR>\nAlleen toegankelijk voor mensen die je in het bericht met een @ apenstaartje vermeldt. Getoond onder &quot;Directe berichten&quot;.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nHet is vaak de gewoonte om langere berichten, gesprekken, of draadjes, met de &quot;Minder openbaar&quot; zichtbaarheid te plaatsen. Hiermee voorkom je dat gedeeltes van gesprekken, of reacties daarop, zonder context in een openbare tijdlijn komen te staan.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Reacties op een bericht hebben standaard dezelfde zichtbaarheid als het bericht waar je op reageert.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Je kunt bijvoorbeeld als je meerdere berichtjes over hetzelfde onderwerp wil plaatsen, het eerste bericht plaatsen met zichtbaarheid &quot;Openbaar&quot; plaatsen en doorzoekbaar maken met een paar hash-tags, en dan daarop reageren met zichtbaarheid &quot;Minder openbaar&quot; voor de rest. Dan kan iedereen het draadje ontdekken, maar alleen het begin van het draadje komt dan in Lokaal en Globaal te staan.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Berichten tooten: CW-kopjes<BR>\nBerichten gerelateerd aan politiek, en ander mogelijk gevoelige onderwerpen zijn niet altijd toegestaan. En is het de sociale norm voor zulke berichten de &quot;CW&quot;-knop gebruiken zodat mensen ervoor mogen kiezen wanneer ze dit wel of niet lezen, afhankelijk van hun humeur (voorbeeld).<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>De CW-knop kan ook in andere gevallen nuttig zijn, zoals:<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Een bericht over de uitkomst van een sportwedstrijd.<BR>\nEen bericht over de plot van een film of TV-serie die momenteel gaande is.<BR>\nVerberg de clou van een mop of raadsel 😃 (voorbeeld).<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Waarin verschilt mastodon.mfbfreaks.nl van Mastodon algemeen en van overige sociale netwerken ?<BR>\n<BR>\nDecentraal<BR>\nMastodonservers zijn decentraal. Dat houdt in dat er vele onafhankelijke servers zijn, die samen het netwerk vormen. Te vergelijken met e-mail, blogs, of wellicht je eigen website. Er is niet één organisatie die eigendom heeft over alle e-mail, of alle websites. Op de server van mfbfreaks.nl zul je lokaal vooral veel mfb en audio gerelateerde berichten tegenkomen. Het mooie is echter wel, net als e-mail, alle overige Mastodon servers elkaar wel kunnen vinden en herkennen. Dit in tegenstelling tot bijvoorbeeld internet forums of chatkanalen, die meestal &quot;eilanden&quot; zijn.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Het decentrale principe betekent ook dat Mastodon niet te koop is, en zo niet kan worden uitgeschakeld. Mocht een decentrale server eigenaar zijn gaan server sluiten, kun je eenvoudig je account en gegevens naar een andere server verhuizen.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Jij doet ertoe<BR>\nElke Mastodon server beheert hun eigen regels en antispam moderatie. Elk bericht komt het netwerk binnen via een server met meestal een kleine groep lokale gebruikers en een actieve eigenaar die verantwoordelijkheid neemt over hun &quot;huis&quot; en dit graag schoon wil houden. Wanneer er onenigheid is kan dit of worden opgelost door de eigenaar van de server waar het bericht vandaan komt, of als de servers andere regels hebben, kan een van de beheerders ervoor kiezen de verbinding tussen twee servers te sluiten en iedereen verder z&#39;n gangetje laten gaan.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Doordat er geen centrale organisatie is die alles beheert, is er dus ook geen organisatie nodig die genoeg winst moet maken om de kosten te dekken. Bijvoorbeeld van het runnen van zo&#39;n gigantisch netwerk, en de nadelen die daarmee komen. Of een algoritme dat bepaalt van wie je berichten ziet om betere advertenties te tonen, of berichten van volgorde verandert of totaal verbergt zodat je meer tijd op hun site doorbrengt i.p.v. ergens anders heengaat, of die je persoonlijke informatie verkoopt aan derden.<BR>\n<BR><\/p>\n\n<p>Op Mastodon staan berichten gewoon in chronologische volgorde. Er zijn geen commerciele advertenties. Sommige Mastodon servers met duizenden gebruiken staan wellicht geen nieuwe gebruikers meer toe. Sommige organisaties kunnen natuurlijk wel om donaties vragen.<BR><\/p>\n","categories":["tech"],"short_description":"mfbfreaks social platform voor liefhebbers van mfb boxen en voor reparatie van philips audio , mfb boxen , hifi en vintage apparatuur"},"name":"mastodon.mfbfreaks.nl","thumbnail":"https:\/\/mastodon.mfbfreaks.nl\/system\/site_uploads\/files\/000\/000\/001\/@1x\/mastodon_plaatje_final_site.png","users":"10"},{"info":{"short_description":"Un servidor alegre i combatiu al Fedivers.

Due to the Data Security Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, data of the user will have potential of being requested by the Chinese government. This allows the instance to protect the privacy of the user.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Why is my registration request rejected?<\/h4>\n\n<p>it is possible that your registration request is rejected due to the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your email address is from Mainland China;<\/li>\n<li>Your registration request is not detailed enough;<\/li>\n<li>Your registration request is not in English or Chinese.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h3>Announcements<\/h3>\n\n<p>For global announcements for the instance (like Server Maintenance), they will be both published on the @admin account and the announcement section (See picture <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.patrickwu.space\/docs\/announcement-en.png\">here<\/a>); For announcements that applies to the instance only (like Emoji Update), they will be only published on the announcement section.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Inactive accounts<\/h3>\n\n<p>Inactive account will be taken certain actions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For accounts that are inactive for 1 month, your account will be frozen ( Prevent any interaction from or to this account but not delete or hide its contents );<\/li>\n<li>For account that is inactive for 3 months, the account will be suspended( Prevent any interaction from or to this account and delete its contents ); <\/li>\n<li>After 30 days of suspension without appeal, your account will be completely deleted. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>For appeal, please send to o0o@wedotstud.io.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Why the Migration?<\/h3>\n\n<p>The instance is an new setup for the old instance.<\/p>\n\n<p>The migration is caused by two major reasons: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Previously, the old instance is installed using <a href=\"https:\/\/yunohost.org\/\">Yunohost<\/a>. Although Yunohost is really easy to help deploy complicated services like Mastodon, its customized installation of Mastodon caused some problem for me, such as editing configuration and set up account migration.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hong Kong&#39;s Largest ISP, PCCW, blocked the IP that <code>*.pigeons.cloud<\/code> is used. This caused the entire service being not accessible under the network that uses PCCW&#39;s service, which covers a large part of Hong Kong.

We are not trying to silence our community or police discussion, but ask that you consider those who may read your posts when making them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Content Warnings are a feature of Mastodon that enable you to hide the body of a &quot;toot&quot; (post) behind a line of text. The intended use of this feature is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and\/or potentially harmful topics without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though content warnings may be used for a wide variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Images can be marked as sensitive. This is a feature which hides an image until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning automatically marks the toot&#39;s images as sensitive.<\/p>\n\n<p>We cannot enforce content warnings on users from other instances, but can help to manage content that you see when reported to instance moderators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please be clear and accurate when labeling content warnings, to ensure that they follow both the letter and spirit of the enforcements that we have.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Above all, try to be polite, and come from a place of mutual respect when discussing content warnings with other. We do not condone tone policing, and want to promote healthy discussion in our community.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This cannot ever be a complete list, and so we want to keep it semi-general, and reserve the right to use the judgement of the moderation team to make decisions in the future.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Enforced Content Warnings:\n        <ul>\n            <li>NSFW\/sexual discussion and imagery must be behind descriptive CWs (nudity, sex, kink discussion, etc)<\/li>\n            <li>Sensitive imagery (please use your best judgement on what content that most other users would find sensitive, such as photos of surgeries, abuse, war, deceased individuals, etc)<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n    <\/li>\n    <li>Suggested Content Warnings:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Discussion of overtly political (relating to elected or unelected government officials) topics<\/li>\n            <li>Triggering topics (direct discussion of rape, trauma, abuse, suicide, transphobia, homophobia, etc). The intention is to provide a warning for users who may not want to consume this content, not to silence users who are sharing their negative experiences.<\/li>\n            <li>Drugs or drug use<\/li>\n            <li>Advertisements for corporations<\/li>\n            <li>\"Rage\" posts and posts using mainly capital letters<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n    <\/li>\n    <li>Suggested Sensitive Image Marking\n        <ul>\n            <li>Eye contact images<\/li>\n            <li>Food related images<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>CryptoCurrency\/NFTs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We do not allow the promotion, advertisement, or sale of cryptocurrencies on our instance.

It's almost certainly a straw man - an offensive and lazy caricature of a group of people you hate. It usually wasn't even real; just satire or a fake account to dunk on. In the rare event it was real, it's deliberately provocative to get rage-shares. Don't give them the attention they want. If you've never heard of them before, ignore it.\n<\/li><li>If you've already seen a dozen posts by different people taking the same stand, don't join in. The 13th post saying the same thing will not convince anyone. No one is taking roll call. You aren't helping, you are just mindlessly spamming.\n<\/li><li>Also don't rage post over something said by a person who has never heard of you and probably never will. Yelling at famous people achieves nothing.\n<\/li><li>No one posts as much as someone who just said they're taking a break from social media and not going to post any more. If you want to stop posting, just stop.\n<\/li><li>Don't hate on other people getting or having good things. Your envy and any actions you take on it will *never* help and will *always* hurt you and others. There are no exceptions. Especially if it's \"not fair\" that they have whatever.\n<\/li><li>How severely someone reacted to something is not evidence for how bad it is. \"I'm scared to go in the street!\" is not evidence the streets are dangerous. \"Mayor asks famous doctor if Pong turns kids to zombies\" is no evidence Pong can zombify you or that the doctor thinks so.\n<\/li><li>Whenever somebody's caught on video saying something awful their fans assert it's \"deceptively edited\". Don't just say that. Link to the unedited video & list exactly what was cut out that invalidates the rest, or you're just trying to pretend it didn't happen.\n<\/li><li>There is not one post worth sharing that begs you to share it. If it has to tell you to re-post or tag friends, it's not worth re-posting.
